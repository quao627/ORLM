Beaker 1 uses 4 units of flour and 6 units of special liquid to make 5 units of slime. Beaker 2 uses 6 units of flour and 3 units of special liquid to make 3 units of slime.  However, beaker 1 creates 4 units of waste while beaker 2 creates 2 units of waste. The summer camp has available 150 units of flour and 100 units of special liquid. If at most 30 units of waste can be produced, how many of each beaker should be used to maximize the amount of slime produced?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " \nLet's formulate this problem as an optimization problem. We want to maximize the amount of slime produced, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nObjective function: Maximize Z = 5x1 + 3x2\n\nWhere x1 is the number of beakers 1 used and x2 is the number of beakers 2 used.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraints:\n\n1.
