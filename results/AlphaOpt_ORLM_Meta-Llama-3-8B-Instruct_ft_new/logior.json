The lengths of the vessels are 287, 196, 261, 288, 208, 238, 190, 217 and 254 respectively. The arrival times of the vessels are 9, 27, 34, 40, 1, 31, 28, 20, and 22 hours respectively, while the required working times for loading and unloading after docking are 7, 31, 31, 25, 29, 11, 28, 24, and 20 hours respectively. The optimal berthing positions for the vessels are 375, 419, 591, 510, 567, 64, 507, 377, and 93 respectively. A berthing plan now needs to be devised, where the additional operational costs caused by deviations from the original optimal berthing positions are 8, 4, 5, 5, 2, 6, 8, 6, and 8 per unit of distance, and the delay costs are 7, 7, 3, 4, 4, 7, 2, 4, and 7 per hour of delay.

The company operates two distribution centers, A and B. Distribution center A is located at coordinates (-5, -5) and has 3 refrigerated trucks with a capacity of 20 tons each. Distribution center B is located at coordinates (5, 5) and has 3 refrigerated trucks with a capacity of 18 tons each. The coordinates of the 10 customers are as follows: (-4.53, -5.12), (2.14, 5.85), (-4.88, -8.33), (2.24, 1.63), (3.91, -5.88), (-1.1, 0.25), (7.92, -3.4), (-1.89, -5.0), (0.72, -8.8), (-1.88, -2.89). Their respective fresh produce demands are 2, 2, 9, 1, 4, 4, 10, 6, 4, and 4 tons. The delivery requirements are as follows: 1. Each truck must depart from its assigned distribution center and return to the same distribution center after completing deliveries; 2. Each customer must be visited exactly once. Under these conditions, what is the shortest total travel distance for the trucks? (The distance between two points is calculated as the straight-line distance.)\n\n# Response:",

Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nA manufacturing plant specializes in producing customized parts, where production is scheduled based on customer orders. The factory has five machines (M1-M5), each with distinct functions: M1 for cutting, M2 for drilling, M3 for welding, M4 for polishing, and M5 for final assembly. Currently, four orders (J1-J4) have been received, each requiring a fixed sequence of processing steps that must be completed on specific machines in a prescribed order. The processing steps, required machines, and execution times for each task are as follows:\n\nJ1: (1) Cutting on M1, taking 3 hours; (2) Drilling on M2, taking 2 hours; (3) Assembly on M5, taking 4 hours.  \nJ2: (1) Welding on M3, taking 4 hours; (2) Polishing on M4, taking 3 hours; (3) Assembly on M5, taking 2 hours.  \nJ3: (1) Drilling on M2, taking 3 hours; (2) Cutting on M1, taking 5 hours; (3) Polishing on M4, taking 2 hours.  \nJ4: (1) Cutting on M1, taking 2 hours; (2) Welding on M3, taking 3 hours; (3) Polishing on M4, taking 4 hours.  \n\nEach machine can only handle one task at a time and cannot process multiple tasks simultaneously. Once a step begins processing, it cannot be paused or interrupted midway. How should the order processing be scheduled to minimize the total completion time for all tasks?\n\n# Response:",

    "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. First, formulate the problem as an optimization problem. Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nGreenWeave specializes in transforming raw materials such as organic cotton, jute, and linen into eco-friendly textiles: organic cotton fabric, jute fabric, and linen fabric. Organic cotton fabric can be manufactured by processing either organic cotton or jute. Linen fabric can be produced from any of the raw materials—organic cotton, jute, or linen. Jute fabric, on the other hand, can be created by processing jute or linen. The production process for organic cotton fabric reduces the input fiber by 30%, leaving 70% for the final product. For linen fabric, the process removes 20% of the input fiber. For jute fabric, the process removes 25% of the input fiber. The costs of purchasing and processing each raw material, along with their availability, are detailed as follows:\n\n| Raw Material      | Purchasing Cost ($/ton) | Processing Cost ($/ton)  | Availability (tons) |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Organic Cotton    | 350                     | 100                      | 1000                |\n| Jute              | 400                     | 80                       | 800                 |\n| Linen             | 300                     | 150                      | 600                 |\n\nTo fulfill market requirements, GreenWeave must produce a minimum of 300 tons of organic cotton fabric fiber, 400 tons of jute fabric fiber, and 200 tons of linen fabric fiber.

The company needs to meet the market demand for these two products across four quarters of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) while aiming to minimize the total annual operating costs, which include labor costs and inventory holding costs. The demand for Product A in the four quarters is 800, 600, 700, and 900 units, respectively; the demand for Product B in the four quarters is 500, 400, 600, and 300 units, respectively.Workers operate on a fixed rotation schedule: each worker works for three consecutive quarters and then takes one quarter off. To ensure that workers take their leave in the same quarter each year, workers are divided into four groups, taking leave in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. The company must decide the number of workers in each group, and this number remains constant throughout the year.

Once brewed, the beer is shipped to two distribution hubs: Seattle and Atlanta. Each distribution hub can handle up to 400,000 gallons per year. Due to differences in shipping and production costs, the profit (in dollars) per thousand gallons shipped depends on the brewery and the destination hub (see Table 1). CraftBrew Inc. is considering expanding the capacity of each brewery. Each thousand gallons of annual production capacity added will cost $1,000 for the Portland brewery and $1,500 for the Asheville brewery. How can CraftBrew Inc. maximize its profits, less expansion costs, over a three-year period?  \n\nTable 1:\n\n| Brewery   | Destination Hub | Profit per Thousand Gallons ($) |  \n|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------|  \n| Portland  | Seattle          | 500                              |  \n| Portland  | Atlanta          | 450                              |  \n| Asheville | Seattle          | 480                              |  \n| Asheville | Atlanta          | 520                              |",

Workers are scheduled in two consecutive 6-hour shifts and are paid $12 per hour. The possible shifts are as follows: midnight–6 A.M., 6 A.M.–noon, noon–6 P.M., and 6 P.M.–midnight. During each shift, the following numbers of orders arrive: midnight–6 A.M., 150; 6 A.M.–noon, 250; noon–6 P.M., 400; 6 P.M.–midnight, 300. Each worker can process up to 60 orders per shift. To account for customer dissatisfaction due to delayed orders, any order that remains unprocessed at the end of a shift incurs a penalty of $1. The warehouse ensures that all orders received by midnight are processed by the start of the next day, so the midnight–6 A.M. shift begins with no pending orders. How can Warehouse 24 minimize the total cost of labor and customer dissatisfaction penalties while meeting its order processing requirements?\n\n| Shift              | Orders Received |  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n| Midnight–6 A.M.    | 150             |  \n| 6 A.M.–Noon        | 250             |  \n| Noon–6 P.M.        | 400             |  \n| 6 P.M.–Midnight    | 300             |\n\n# Response:",

Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nLogiTech’s main distribution center is organized into two key areas: a packaging area located at coordinates (0, 0) and a loading dock located at coordinates (800, 600) (distances are in meters). The company must determine where to locate a sorting facility and a storage facility to minimize the daily cost of moving goods through the center. All movement within the distribution center is restricted to either east–west or north–south directions.  \n\nThe number of daily trips between the areas are as follows:  \n\n| From/To          | Packaging Area | Loading Dock | Sorting Facility | Storage Facility |  \n|-------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|  \n| Packaging Area    | -              | 20           | 15                | 10               |  \n| Loading Dock      | 20             | -            | 25                | 30               |  \n| Sorting Facility  | 15             | 25           | -                 | 40               |  \n| Storage Facility  | 10             | 30           | 40                | -                |  \n\nThe cost of moving goods is $0.50 per meter per trip. The sorting facility and storage facility must be located within the boundaries of the distribution center, which spans from (0, 0) to (1000, 1000).

    "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. First, formulate the problem as an optimization problem. Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nAn assembly line needs to produce a product with 10 tasks. The cycle time is 66 time units. The tasks, their durations, and precedence relationships are given in the following table:\n\nTask | Duration | Predecessors\n-----|----------|-------------\n1    | 36       | -\n2    | 36       | 1\n3    | 30       | -\n4    | 30       | 3\n5    | 24       | 1,4\n6    | 30       | 5\n7    | 24       | 2\n8    | 12       | 6,7\n9    | 54       | 8\n10   | 12       | 9\n\nThe problem requires assigning these tasks to workstations while respecting the precedence relationships and cycle time constraint, with the objective of minimizing the number of workstations needed. Each task must be assigned to exactly one workstation, and the total duration of tasks assigned to any workstation cannot exceed the cycle time of 66 units.\n\n# Response:",

Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nA large-scale logistics company specializes in transporting a wide variety of perishable goods from a central distribution hub to several supermarket chains. The company uses a fleet of advanced refrigerated trucks, and for a specific delivery route, one truck needs to be loaded. Each truck has strict capacity limits in four dimensions: a maximum weight of 12 tons, a total volume of 35 m³, a refrigeration power output of 40 kW, and a total cool-down time budget of 100 hours (a proxy for the energy and time required to bring goods to their optimal temperature and maintain it).\n\nThe goods are classified into 10 distinct categories. For each category, the company can choose from 5 different variants, each sourced from a different supplier and having unique characteristics. The company must select exactly one variant from each of the 10 categories to be included in the shipment with the primary goal to maximize the total profit.\n\nFurthermore, there are two special conditions for this delivery:\n1.  Product Synergy: If Variant B of Fruits (Category 1) and Variant C of Baked Goods (Category 6) are shipped together, a special packaging collaboration creates an additional bonus profit of $150.\n2.  Product Conflict: Due to the high risk of cross-contamination, shipping Variant A of Seafood (Category 5) and Variant A of Dairy (Category 3) together is forbidden.\n\nThe complete data for all available goods is as follows:\n\n| Category | Variant | Weight (t) | Volume (m³) | Power (kW) | Cool-Down (hr) | Profit ($) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1: Fruits** | A | 1.1 | 2.8 | 2.0 | 8.0 | 210 |\n| | B | 1.3 | 3.2 | 2.5 | 10.0 | 290 |\n| | C | 0.9 | 2.4 | 1.8 | 7.0 | 190 |\n| | D | 1.4 | 3.5 | 2.8 | 11.0 | 320 |\n| | E | 1.0 | 2.6 | 1.9 | 7.5 | 200 |\n| **2: Vegetables** | A | 0.8 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 160 |\n| | B | 1.0 | 2.5 | 1.5 | 6.0 | 230 |\n| | C | 0.7 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 4.5 | 140 |\n| | D | 1.2 | 2.8 | 1.8 | 7.0 | 260 |\n| | E | 0.9 | 2.2 | 1.2 | 5.5 | 190 |\n| **3: Dairy** | A | 1.5 | 4.5 | 4.2 | 12.0 | 360 |\n| | B | 1.3 | 4.0 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 310 |\n| | C | 1.7 | 5.0 | 4.8 | 14.0 | 420 |\n| | D | 1.4 | 4.2 | 3.8 | 11.0 | 340 |\n| | E | 1.6 | 4.8 | 4.5 | 13.0 | 400 |\n| **4: Meat** | A | 1.9 | 4.0 | 6.5 | 15.0 | 520 |\n| | B | 1.6 | 3.5 | 5.5 | 13.0 | 460 |\n| | C | 2.1 | 4.5 | 7.2 | 17.0 | 580 |\n| | D | 1.8 | 3.8 | 6.0 | 14.0 | 500 |\n| | E | 2.2 | 4.8 | 7.5 | 18.0 | 600 |\n| **5: Seafood** | A | 1.4 | 3.0 | 8.0 | 16.0 | 480 |\n| | B | 1.2 | 2.8 | 7.0 | 14.0 | 430 |\n| | C | 1.6 | 3.5 | 9.0 | 18.0 | 550 |\n| | D | 1.3 | 2.9 | 7.5 | 15.0 | 450 |\n| | E | 1.7 | 3.8 | 9.5 | 19.0 | 590 |\n| **6: Baked Goods**| A | 0.5 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 2.0 | 90 |\n| | B | 0.7 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 3.0 | 140 |\n| | C | 0.6 | 1.8 | 0.6 | 2.5 | 120 |\n| | D | 0.8 | 2.2 | 1.0 | 3.5 | 160 |\n| | E | 0.4 | 1.2 | 0.4 | 1.5 | 80 |\n| **7: Beverages** | A | 1.8 | 3.0 | 1.5 | 4.0 | 250 |\n| | B | 2.0 | 3.5 | 1.8 | 5.0 | 290 |\n| | C | 1.6 | 2.8 | 1.4 | 3.5 | 220 |\n| | D | 2.2 | 3.8 | 2.0 | 6.0 | 330 |\n| | E | 1.7 | 2.9 | 1.6 | 4.5 | 240 |\n| **8: Frozen** | A | 2.0 | 5.0 | 8.0 | 20.0 | 500 |\n| | B | 1.8 | 4.5 | 7.0 | 18.0 | 450 |\n| | C | 2.3 | 5.5 | 9.0 | 22.0 | 580 |\n| | D | 2.1 | 5.2 | 8.5 | 21.0 | 540 |\n| | E | 2.5 | 6.0 | 9.8 | 24.0 | 620 |\n| **9: Deli Meats** | A | 0.9 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 6.0 | 180 |\n| | B | 1.1 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 7.0 | 240 |\n| | C | 0.8 | 1.8 | 2.8 | 5.5 | 160 |\n| | D | 1.2 | 2.8 | 4.0 | 8.0 | 270 |\n| | E | 1.0 | 2.2 | 3.2 | 6.5 | 210 |\n| **10: Prepared** | A | 1.3 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 9.0 | 300 |\n| | B | 1.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 10.0 | 350 |\n| | C | 1.2 | 2.8 | 3.8 | 8.0 | 280 |\n| | D | 1.6 | 3.8 | 5.0 | 11.0 | 380 |\n| | E | 1.4 | 3.2 | 4.2 | 9.5 | 330 |\n\n# Response:",

    "description": "A regional tobacco distribution company operates three distribution centers located in different zones of a metropolitan area to serve 15 retail outlets. The company needs to optimize its weekly delivery operations to minimize total transportation costs while satisfying regulatory constraints and customer demands.\n\nThe three distribution centers have different storage capacities and operational costs. Center A can handle up to 800 units per week with a fixed operating cost of $2,500, Center B can handle up to 600 units per week with a fixed cost of $2,000, and Center C can handle up to 500 units per week with a fixed cost of $1,800. Each retail outlet has specific weekly demand requirements ranging from 45 to 120 units, and due to regulatory compliance, each outlet must receive deliveries from exactly one distribution center to maintain proper tracking and accountability.\n\nThe transportation cost varies based on the distance between distribution centers and retail outlets, ranging from $8 to $25 per unit delivered. Additionally, there are regulatory constraints that limit the maximum number of outlets each distribution center can serve - Center A can serve at most 7 outlets, Center B can serve at most 6 outlets, and Center C can serve at most 5 outlets. The company must also ensure that the total demand assigned to each center does not exceed its capacity, and all retail outlets must be served to maintain market coverage.\n\n| Outlet | Demand | Cost from A | Cost from B | Cost from C |\n|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1      | 85     | $12         | $18         | $22         |\n| 2      | 67     | $15         | $11         | $25         |\n| 3      | 92     | $20         | $14         | $16         |\n| 4      | 78     | $13         | $19         | $23         |\n| 5      | 105    | $17         | $12         | $20         |\n| 6      | 56     | $25         | $16         | $14         |\n| 7      | 120    | $14         | $21         | $18         |\n| 8      | 73     | $16         | $13         | $24         |\n| 9      | 89     | $19         | $15         | $17         |\n| 10     | 95     | $11         | $22         | $19         |\n| 11     | 62     | $23         | $17         | $15         |\n| 12     | 84     | $18         | $14         | $21         |\n| 13     | 76     | $21         | $20         | $13         |\n| 14     | 45     | $24         | $25         | $16         |\n| 15     | 58     | $22         | $23         | $12         |",

The company needs to optimize its weekly delivery operations to minimize total transportation costs while satisfying regulatory constraints and customer demands.\n\nThe three distribution centers have different storage capacities and operational costs. Center A can handle up to 800 units per week with a fixed operating cost of $2,500, Center B can handle up to 600 units per week with a fixed cost of $2,000, and Center C can handle up to 500 units per week with a fixed cost of $1,800. Each retail outlet has specific weekly demand requirements ranging from 45 to 120 units, and due to regulatory compliance, each outlet must receive deliveries from exactly one distribution center to maintain proper tracking and accountability.\n\nThe transportation cost varies based on the distance between distribution centers and retail outlets, ranging from $8 to $25 per unit delivered. Additionally, there are regulatory constraints that limit the maximum number of outlets each distribution center can serve - Center A can serve at most 7 outlets, Center B can serve at most 6 outlets, and Center C can serve at most 5 outlets.

The transportation cost is fixed at $0.80 per unit per mile, and the planning horizon is a full year (365 days).\n\nThe plan must assign each store to exactly one hub, ensure that no hub's daily capacity is exceeded, meet the minimum average reliability standard, and minimize the total annual cost.\n\nHub Data:  \n\n| Hub ID | Daily Setup Cost | Daily Capacity (units) | Reliability |\n|:------:|:----------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------:|\n| 1      | $100,000         | 1000                   | 0.85        |\n| 2      | $80,000          | 800                    | 0.90        |\n| 3      | $120,000         | 1500                   | 0.70        |\n| 4      | $90,000          | 1200                   | 0.95        |\n| 5      | $110,000         | 900                    | 0.80        |\n\nStore Demand Data (units per day):  \n\n| Store | Demand | | Store | Demand | | Store | Demand |\n|:-----:|:------:| |:-----:|:------:| |:-----:|:------:|\n| 1     | 151    | | 6     | 187    | | 11    | 121    |\n| 2     | 188    | | 7     | 199    | | 12    | 173    |\n| 3     | 174    | | 8     | 104    | | 13    | 100    |\n| 4     | 161    | | 9     | 116    | | 14    | 187    |\n| 5     | 111    | | 10    | 88     | | 15    | 199    |\n\nDistance Matrix (Hub to Store, in miles):  \n\n| Hub | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | S6 | S7 | S8 | S9 | S10 | S11 | S12 | S13 | S14 | S15 |\n|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|  1  | 18 | 45 | 42 | 38 | 18 | 44 | 47 | 12 | 20 | 10  | 23  | 41  | 10  | 44  | 47  |\n|  2  | 30 | 27 | 21 | 16 | 17 | 12 | 29 | 21 | 38 | 48  | 23  | 15  | 12  | 20  | 26  |\n|  3  | 16 | 13 | 21 | 31 | 30 | 39 | 44 | 44 | 18 | 12  | 13  | 16  | 42  | 49  | 11  |\n|  4  | 34 | 25 | 30 | 20 | 24 | 28 | 42 | 39 | 31 | 44  | 34  | 11  | 36  | 16  | 23  |\n|  5  | 49 | 41 | 17 | 34 | 16 | 49 | 49 | 28 | 42 | 18  | 46  | 23  | 29  | 21  | 49  |\n\n# Response:",

    "description": "PharmaLogistics Inc. is planning the distribution network for its new temperature-sensitive drug, 'VitaBoost', for the upcoming 6 months (Month 1 to Month 6). The company has two manufacturing plants (P1 located in City A, P2 located in City B) and is considering opening and operating up to three potential distribution centers (DC1 in Region X, DC2 in Region Y, DC3 in Region Z) to serve four key demand regions (R1, R2, R3, R4). The primary objective is to minimize the total operational costs over the 6-month planning horizon. These costs include: the fixed monthly costs of operating any active DCs, transportation costs for shipping VitaBoost from plants to DCs and from DCs to demand regions, inventory holding costs for products stored at DCs, costs associated with product expiry and disposal, and shortage costs incurred for any unmet demand in the regions.\n\nVitaBoost has a strict shelf life of 2 months. This means that any product manufactured in a given month (say, Month `m`) must be used to satisfy demand by the end of the following month (Month `m+1`). Product not used by this deadline expires and must be disposed of.\n\nAt the beginning of Month 1, DC1 has an initial stock of VitaBoost, provided it is chosen to be operational in Month 1: 10 units that were produced in the immediately preceding month (referred to as 'Month 0' batch, thus being 1-month old at the start of Month 1) and 5 units that were produced two months prior (referred to as 'Month -1' batch, thus being 2-months old at the start of Month 1). This 'Month -1' batch must be used or discarded during Month 1. No other initial inventory exists at other potential DCs or plants.\n\nThe monthly production capacities for the manufacturing plants are as follows (in units, for Months 1 through 6 respectively):\n-   Plant P1: [250, 250, 260, 260, 270, 270]\n-   Plant P2: [200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220]\n\nThe potential distribution centers have associated costs and capacities:\n-   Fixed monthly operating costs if active: DC1: $10,000; DC2: $12,000; DC3: $9,000.\n-   Storage capacities (max units): DC1: 300; DC2: 350; DC3: 280.\n\nTransportation costs per unit of VitaBoost are:\n-   From Plant P1 to DCs: DC1: $5, DC2: $7, DC3: $6.\n-   From Plant P2 to DCs: DC1: $8, DC2: $4, DC3: $7.\n-   From DC1 to Regions: R1: $3, R2: $4, R3: $5, R4: $6.\n-   From DC2 to Regions: R1: $5, R2: $3, R3: $4, R4: $5.\n-   From DC3 to Regions: R1: $4, R2: $5, R3: $3, R4: $4.\n\nOther relevant costs are:\n-   Monthly inventory holding cost per unit at DCs: DC1: $2.0; DC2: $2.5; DC3: $1.8.\n-   Disposal cost for expired product: $1 per unit at any DC.\n-   Shortage cost for unmet demand: $50 per unit, uniform across all regions and months.\n\nThe forecasted monthly demand for VitaBoost (in units) for each region over the 6-month horizon is:\n-   Region R1: [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]\n-   Region R2: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105]\n-   Region R3: [120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145]\n-   Region R4: [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]\n\nPharmaLogistics Inc. needs to determine an optimal plan that specifies: which DCs to operate in each month, the quantity of VitaBoost to produce at each plant monthly, and the detailed shipping and inventory quantities across the network. This plan must ensure that demand is met as effectively as possible while respecting the product's shelf life and minimizing total costs.",

    "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. First, formulate the problem as an optimization problem. Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nPharmaLogistics Inc. is planning the distribution network for its new temperature-sensitive drug, 'VitaBoost', for the upcoming 6 months (Month 1 to Month 6). The company has two manufacturing plants (P1 located in City A, P2 located in City B) and is considering opening and operating up to three potential distribution centers (DC1 in Region X, DC2 in Region Y, DC3 in Region Z) to serve four key demand regions (R1, R2, R3, R4). The primary objective is to minimize the total operational costs over the 6-month planning horizon. These costs include: the fixed monthly costs of operating any active DCs, transportation costs for shipping VitaBoost from plants to DCs and from DCs to demand regions, inventory holding costs for products stored at DCs, costs associated with product expiry and disposal, and shortage costs incurred for any unmet demand in the regions.\n\nVitaBoost has a strict shelf life of 2 months. This means that any product manufactured in a given month (say, Month `m`) must be used to satisfy demand by the end of the following month (Month `m+1`). Product not used by this deadline expires and must be disposed of.\n\nAt the beginning of Month 1, DC1 has an initial stock of VitaBoost, provided it is chosen to be operational in Month 1: 10 units that were produced in the immediately preceding month (referred to as 'Month 0' batch, thus being 1-month old at the start of Month 1) and 5 units that were produced two months prior (referred to as 'Month -1' batch, thus being 2-months old at the start of Month 1). This 'Month -1' batch must be used or discarded during Month 1. No other initial inventory exists at other potential DCs or plants.\n\nThe monthly production capacities for the manufacturing plants are as follows (in units, for Months 1 through 6 respectively):\n-   Plant P1: [250, 250, 260, 260, 270, 270]\n-   Plant P2: [200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220]\n\nThe potential distribution centers have associated costs and capacities:\n-   Fixed monthly operating costs if active: DC1: $10,000; DC2: $12,000; DC3: $9,000.\n-   Storage capacities (max units): DC1: 300; DC2: 350; DC3: 280.\n\nTransportation costs per unit of VitaBoost are:\n-   From Plant P1 to DCs: DC1: $5, DC2: $7, DC3: $6.\n-   From Plant P2 to DCs: DC1: $8, DC2: $4, DC3: $7.\n-   From DC1 to Regions: R1: $3, R2: $4, R3: $5, R4: $6.\n-   From DC2 to Regions: R1: $5, R2: $3, R3: $4, R4: $5.\n-   From DC3 to Regions: R1: $4, R2: $5, R3: $3, R4: $4.\n\nOther relevant costs are:\n-   Monthly inventory holding cost per unit at DCs: DC1: $2.0; DC2: $2.5; DC3: $1.8.\n-   Disposal cost for expired product: $1 per unit at any DC.\n-   Shortage cost for unmet demand: $50 per unit, uniform across all regions and months.\n\nThe forecasted monthly demand for VitaBoost (in units) for each region over the 6-month horizon is:\n-   Region R1: [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]\n-   Region R2: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105]\n-   Region R3: [120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145]\n-   Region R4: [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]\n\nPharmaLogistics Inc. needs to determine an optimal plan that specifies: which DCs to operate in each month, the quantity of VitaBoost to produce at each plant monthly, and the detailed shipping and inventory quantities across the network. This plan must ensure that demand is met as effectively as possible while respecting the product's shelf life and minimizing total costs.\n\n# Response:",

    "description": "A large manufacturing enterprise needs to ship a consignment of 1,000 tons of goods from its factory in City F to a distribution center in City D. There are three potential transportation routes available. Each route is composed of segments using different modes of transport (road or rail). The transportation cost for each segment is calculated based on a per ton-kilometer rate. Furthermore, certain road segments are subject to a congestion fee to account for the social costs of traffic. This fee is non-linear and is calculated as `Congestion Coefficient * (Total Traffic Flow)^2`. The total traffic flow on a segment is the sum of the cargo shipped by the enterprise and the existing background traffic from other companies.\n\nThe details for the three routes are provided in the table below. For congested segments, the existing background traffic is also listed.\n\n| Route | Segment | Mode | Distance (km) | Base Fee ($/ton-km) | Congestion Coefficient | Background Traffic (tons) |\n| ----- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 1     | 1A      | Road | 150           | 2.00                | 5×10−7                 | 2,000                     |\n|       | 1B      | Rail | 500           | 0.80                | -                      | -                         |\n| 2     | 2A      | Road | 200           | 2.10                | -                      | -                         |\n|       | 2B      | Road | 350           | 1.90                | 8×10−7                 | 1,500                     |\n| 3     | 3A      | Road | 100           | 2.20                | -                      | -                         |\n|       | 3B      | Rail | 600           | 0.75                | -                      | -                         |\n\nHow should the enterprise allocate the shipment of 1,000 tons of goods across the three routes to minimize the total transportation cost?",

    "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. First, formulate the problem as an optimization problem. Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nA large manufacturing enterprise needs to ship a consignment of 1,000 tons of goods from its factory in City F to a distribution center in City D. There are three potential transportation routes available. Each route is composed of segments using different modes of transport (road or rail). The transportation cost for each segment is calculated based on a per ton-kilometer rate. Furthermore, certain road segments are subject to a congestion fee to account for the social costs of traffic. This fee is non-linear and is calculated as `Congestion Coefficient * (Total Traffic Flow)^2`. The total traffic flow on a segment is the sum of the cargo shipped by the enterprise and the existing background traffic from other companies.\n\nThe details for the three routes are provided in the table below. For congested segments, the existing background traffic is also listed.\n\n| Route | Segment | Mode | Distance (km) | Base Fee ($/ton-km) | Congestion Coefficient | Background Traffic (tons) |\n| ----- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 1     | 1A      | Road | 150           | 2.00                | 5×10−7                 | 2,000                     |\n|       | 1B      | Rail | 500           | 0.80                | -                      | -                         |\n| 2     | 2A      | Road | 200           | 2.10                | -                      | -                         |\n|       | 2B      | Road | 350           | 1.90                | 8×10−7                 | 1,500                     |\n| 3     | 3A      | Road | 100           | 2.20                | -                      | -                         |\n|       | 3B      | Rail | 600           | 0.75                | -                      | -                         |\n\nHow should the enterprise allocate the shipment of 1,000 tons of goods across the three routes to minimize the total transportation cost?\n\n# Response:",

    "description": "A container shipping company needs to execute a transport contract from Shanghai to Los Angeles, a total sailing distance of 6000 nautical miles. The voyage must be completed within 12 days (288 hours). The company can choose one of three different types of vessels from its fleet to carry out this mission. The fuel consumption rate for each vessel is an approximate quadratic function of its sailing speed v. The price of fuel is ¥4000 per ton. Additionally, due to new environmental regulations, the company must pay for its carbon dioxide emissions at a rate of ¥300 per ton of CO2. Specific information for the three vessels is shown in Table 1, including their fuel consumption formulas, CO2 emission factors, and a fixed cost for selecting each vessel.\n\nTable 1: Vessel Information \n\n| Vessel | Fuel Consumption (tons/hour) | CO2 Emission Factor (ton CO2/ton fuel) | Selection Fixed Cost (¥) |\n|------|----------------------------------|------|---------|\n| Ship A | $0.005 \\times v^2 + 0.1v + 1.2$  | 3.2  | 500,000 |\n| Ship B | $0.004 \\times v^2 + 0.08v + 1.5$ | 3.15 | 600,000 |\n| Ship C | $0.006 \\times v^2 + 0.12v + 1.0$ | 3.25 | 450,000 |\n\nThe objective is to select one vessel and determine its optimal sailing speed to minimize the total cost of the voyage.",

    "prompt": "Below is an operations research question. First, formulate the problem as an optimization problem. Then according to the formulated problem, write python code that uses 'gurobipy' to solve the optimization problem.\n\n# Question:\nA container shipping company needs to execute a transport contract from Shanghai to Los Angeles, a total sailing distance of 6000 nautical miles. The voyage must be completed within 12 days (288 hours). The company can choose one of three different types of vessels from its fleet to carry out this mission. The fuel consumption rate for each vessel is an approximate quadratic function of its sailing speed v. The price of fuel is ¥4000 per ton. Additionally, due to new environmental regulations, the company must pay for its carbon dioxide emissions at a rate of ¥300 per ton of CO2. Specific information for the three vessels is shown in Table 1, including their fuel consumption formulas, CO2 emission factors, and a fixed cost for selecting each vessel.\n\nTable 1: Vessel Information \n\n| Vessel | Fuel Consumption (tons/hour) | CO2 Emission Factor (ton CO2/ton fuel) | Selection Fixed Cost (¥) |\n|------|----------------------------------|------|---------|\n| Ship A | $0.005 \\times v^2 + 0.1v + 1.2$  | 3.2  | 500,000 |\n| Ship B | $0.004 \\times v^2 + 0.08v + 1.5$ | 3.15 | 600,000 |\n| Ship C | $0.006 \\times v^2 + 0.12v + 1.0$ | 3.25 | 450,000 |\n\nThe objective is to select one vessel and determine its optimal sailing speed to minimize the total cost of the voyage.\n\n# Response:",

    "description": "A shared mobility company plans to deploy a fleet of 1,000 electric scooters across five key hotspot zones in a city. To ensure service stability and a positive user experience, the company aims to achieve a balanced deployment that aligns with the demand profile of each zone.\n\nThe company's goal is to minimize the network's imbalance. This imbalance is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the number of scooters deployed in each zone and an ideal, attractiveness-weighted deployment. The ideal deployment for a zone is calculated by distributing the total fleet proportionally to that zone's share of the total attractiveness.\n\nWhen planning the deployment, the following conditions must be met:\n1. The total number of scooters deployed across all zones must equal 1,000.\n2. To align operational capacity with potential demand, the number of scooters in each zone must not be less than a minimum quota. This quota is set at 10% of the total fleet size, weighted by the proportion of that zone's attractiveness relative to the total attractiveness of all zones.\n3. The 'Commercial Center' and 'Transit Hub' zones are geographically adjacent and frequently interact with each other. To ensure service continuity, the absolute difference in the number of scooters deployed in these two zones must not exceed 50.\n4. The company has divided the zones into two operational clusters: Cluster 1 (Commercial Center, Tourist Area) and Cluster 2 (University City, Tech Park, Transit Hub). Each cluster can deploy a maximum of 600 scooters to match the management capacity of local operational teams.\n\nThe attractiveness data for each zone is provided in the table below.

The truck has a maximum refrigerated capacity of 2 cubic meters and a payload limit of 500 kilograms. The truck will depart from the food bank at 13:00 and must return by 17:00, for a total operating time of 4 hours. The food bank's geographic coordinates are (0, 0), and the units for all location coordinates are kilometers (km). The truck's travel speed is a constant 40 km/h, and the distance between two points is calculated using straight-line Euclidean distance.
