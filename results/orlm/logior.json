Each flight can only be assigned to one gate: \\[\\sum_{j \\in \\{G1, G2\\}} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n2. Flights assigned to the same gate must have non-overlapping time intervals: \\[x_{ij} + x_{kj} \\leq 1, \\forall i, k, i \\neq k, j\\]\n3. Binary constraints for gate assignment: \\[x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\forall i, j\\]\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal gate assignment for each flight, minimizing the total delay cost while ensuring that flights assigned to the same gate have non-overlapping time intervals. This will provide the airport with an economically efficient flight gate assignment strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the airport gate assignment problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"AirportGateAssignment\")\n\n# Define flights and gates\nflights = ['F1', 'F2', 'F3', 'F4']\ngates = ['G1', 'G2']\n\n# Define flight time intervals\nflight_times = {\n    'F1': (10, 11),\n    'F2': (10, 11),\n    'F3': (11, 12),\n    'F4': (10, 11)\n}\n\n# Define decision variables\nx = {}\nfor i in flights:\n    for j in gates:\n        x[i, j] = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Add constraints\n# Each flight can only be assigned to one gate\nfor i in flights:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for j in gates) == 1, name=f\"Assign_{i}\")\n\n# Flights assigned to the same gate must have non-overlapping time intervals\nfor j in gates:\n    for i in flights:\n        for k in flights:\n            if i != k:\n                model.addConstr(x[i, j] + x[k, j] <= 1, name=f\"Overlap_{i}_{k}_{j}\")\n\n# Define objective function\ndelay_cost = {}\nfor i in flights:\n    for j in gates:\n        start, end = flight_times[i]\n        gate_start, gate_end = 10, 13  # Assume gate time intervals are 10:00-13:00\n        delay = max(0, (gate_start - end) + (start - gate_end))  # Calculate delay time\n        delay_cost[i, j] = delay\n        model.addVar(vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=f\"delay_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(delay_cost[i, j] * x[i, j] for i in flights for j in gates), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total delay cost:\", model.objval)\n    for i in flights:\n        for j in gates:\n            if x[i, j].x == 1:\n                print(f\"Flight {i} assigned to gate {j}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define the flights, gates, and the time intervals for each flight. Then, we create binary decision variables `x[i, j]` to represent whether flight `i` is assigned to gate `j`.\n\nNext, we add two types of constraints:\n1. Each flight can only be assigned to one gate.\n2. Flights assigned to the same gate must have non-overlapping time intervals.\n\nWhen defining the objective function, we calculate the delay time for each flight assigned to each gate and multiply it by the corresponding decision variable to obtain the delay cost. The objective function is to minimize the total delay cost.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the optimal solution (if it exists). The output includes the minimum total delay cost and the gate assignment for each flight.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes the gate time intervals are 10:00-13:00.

Find a loading method that uses the minimum number of boxes to pack all 7 items.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the packing problem for the logistics company, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the number of boxes used while ensuring that all items are packed. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): If item \\(i\\) is packed in box \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ij} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ij} = 0\\). Here, \\(i\\) represents the items (1, 2, ..., 7), and \\(j\\) represents the boxes (1, 2, ..., 6).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the number of boxes used: \\[Z = \\sum_{j=1}^{6} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{7} x_{ij} \\geq 1 \\right)\\]\n  - This function calculates the number of boxes used based on whether each box contains at least one item.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each item can only be packed in one box: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{6} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n2. The total load of each box does not exceed its capacity: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{7} x_{ij} \\cdot \\text{load}_i \\leq \\text{capacity}_j, \\forall j\\]\n3. Binary constraints: \\[x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\forall i, j\\]\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find a loading method that uses the minimum number of boxes to pack all items while satisfying the constraints of each box's capacity. This will provide the logistics company with an economically efficient packing strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the packing problem for the logistics company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogisticsPacking\")\n\n# Box capacities\nbox_capacities = [5, 9, 8, 7, 7, 8]\n\n# Item loads\nitem_weights = [6, 7, 8, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {}\nfor i in range(len(item_weights)):\n    for j in range(len(box_capacities)):\n        x[i, j] = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Objective function: Minimize the number of boxes used\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(cp.any(x[i, j] for j in range(len(box_capacities))) for i in range(len(item_weights))), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Each item can only be packed in one box\nfor i in range(len(item_weights)):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for j in range(len(box_capacities))) == 1, name=f\"Item_{i}\")\n\n# The total load of each box does not exceed its capacity\nfor j in range(len(box_capacities)):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] * item_weights[i] for i in range(len(item_weights))) <= box_capacities[j], name=f\"Box_{j}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum number of boxes used:\", model.objval)\n    for i in range(len(item_weights)):\n        for j in range(len(box_capacities)):\n            if x[i, j].x == 1:\n                print(f\"Item {i+1} packed in Box {j+1}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a COPT environment and model. Then, we define the box capacities and item loads.\n\nNext, we add binary decision variables `x[i, j]`, representing whether item `i` is packed in box `j`.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize the number of boxes used, which is achieved by calculating the number of boxes that contain at least one item.\n\nThe constraints include:\n1. Each item can only be packed in one box.\n2. The total load of each box does not exceed its capacity.\n\nFinally, we solve the model and output the results. If an optimal solution is found, we print the minimum number of boxes used and the box number for each item.

And shipments from any warehouse to any location cannot exceed 625 units. How to allocate shipments to minimize total transportation cost?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this transportation problem, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize total transportation cost while satisfying the demands of each sales location, the inventory constraints of each warehouse, and the shipment constraints. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\nDefine a three-dimensional decision variable \\(x_{ijk}\\), where \\(i\\) represents the warehouse (1, 2, 3), \\(j\\) represents the product (1, 2, 3), and \\(k\\) represents the sales location (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). \\(x_{ijk}\\) represents the quantity of product \\(j\\) shipped from warehouse \\(i\\) to sales location \\(k\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total transportation cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\sum_{k=1}^{7} (transportation\\_cost_{ijk} \\times x_{ijk})\\]\n  - This function calculates the total transportation cost based on the transportation cost and quantity of each product from each warehouse to each sales location.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Satisfy the demands of each sales location: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{ijk} = demand_{jk}, \\forall j, k\\]\n2. Do not exceed the inventory of each warehouse: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\sum_{k=1}^{7} x_{ijk} \\leq inventory_{ij}, \\forall i, j\\]\n3. Shipment constraints: \\[x_{ijk} \\leq 625, \\forall i, j, k\\]\n4. Non-negativity constraints: \\[x_{ijk} \\geq 0, \\forall i, j, k\\]\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal quantities of each product to be shipped from each warehouse to each sales location, minimizing total transportation cost while satisfying the demands of each sales location, the inventory constraints of each warehouse, and the shipment constraints. This will provide the company with an economically efficient transportation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this transportation problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TransportationProblem\")\n\n# Define index sets\nwarehouses = [1, 2, 3]\nproducts = [1, 2, 3]\nlocations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n# Define parameters\ninventory = {(1, 1): 600, (1, 2): 900, (1, 3): 750,\n             (2, 1): 500, (2, 2): 1500, (2, 3): 1200,\n             (3, 1): 800, (3, 2): 1100, (3, 3): 1000}\ndemand = {(1, 1): 200, (1, 2): 400, (1, 3): 300,\n          (2, 1): 300, (2, 2): 800, (2, 3): 50,\n          (3, 1): 200, (3, 2): 300, (3, 3): 50,\n          (4, 1): 75, (4, 2): 250, (4, 3): 80,\n          (5, 1): 600, (5, 2): 700, (5, 3): 200,\n          (6, 1): 225, (6, 2): 850, (6, 3): 100,\n          (7, 1): 300, (7, 2): 200, (7, 3): 200}\ntransport_cost = {(1, 1, 1): 30, (1, 1, 2): 10, (1, 1, 3): 8, (1, 1, 4): 10, (1, 1, 5): 11, (1, 1, 6): 71, (1, 1, 7): 6,\n                  (1, 2, 1): 39, (1, 2, 2): 14, (1, 2, 3): 11, (1, 2, 4): 14, (1, 2, 5): 16, (1, 2, 6): 82, (1, 2, 7): 8,\n                  (1, 3, 1): 41, (1, 3, 2): 15, (1, 3, 3): 12, (1, 3, 4): 16, (1, 3, 5): 17, (1, 3, 6): 86, (1, 3, 7): 8,\n                  (2, 1, 1): 22, (2, 1, 2): 7, (2, 1, 3): 10, (2, 1, 4): 7, (2, 1, 5): 21, (2, 1, 6): 82, (2, 1, 7): 13,\n                  (2, 2, 1): 27, (2, 2, 2): 9, (2, 2, 3): 12, (2, 2, 4): 9, (2, 2, 5): 26, (2, 2, 6): 95, (2, 2, 7): 17,\n                  (2, 3, 1): 29, (2, 3, 2): 9, (2, 3, 3): 13, (2, 3, 4): 9, (2, 3, 5): 28, (2, 3, 6): 99, (2, 3, 7): 18,\n                  (3, 1, 1): 19, (3, 1, 2): 11, (3, 1, 3): 12, (3, 1, 4): 10, (3, 1, 5): 25, (3, 1, 6): 83, (3, 1, 7): 15,\n                  (3, 2, 1): 24, (3, 2, 2): 14, (3, 2, 3): 17, (3, 2, 4): 13, (3, 2, 5): 28, (3, 2, 6): 99, (3, 2, 7): 20,\n                  (3, 3, 1): 26, (3, 3, 2): 14, (3, 3, 3): 17, (3, 3, 4): 13, (3, 3, 5): 31, (3, 3, 6): 104, (3, 3, 7): 20}\n\n# Define decision variables\nx = {(i, j, k): model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}_{k}\") for i in warehouses for j in products for k in locations}\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(transport_cost[i, j, k] * x[i, j, k] for i in warehouses for j in products for k in locations), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\n# Satisfy the demands of each sales location\nfor j in products:\n    for k in locations:\n        model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] for i in warehouses) == demand[k, j], name=f\"Demand_{j}_{k}\")\n\n# Do not exceed the inventory of each warehouse\nfor i in warehouses:\n    for j in products:\n        model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] for k in locations) <= inventory[i, j], name=f\"Inventory_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Shipment constraints\nfor i in warehouses:\n    for j in products:\n        for k in locations:\n            model.addConstr(x[i, j, k] <= 625, name=f\"ShipmentLimit_{i}_{j}_{k}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total transportation cost: {model.objval}\")\n    print(\"Optimal transportation plan:\")\n    for i in warehouses:\n        for j in products:\n            for k in locations:\n                if x[i, j, k].x > 0:\n                    print(f\"Ship {x[i, j, k].x} units of Product {j} from Warehouse {i} to Location {k}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first defines the index sets, parameters, and decision variables of the problem.

What is the minimum total time spent?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this problem, we can construct an integer programming model to minimize the total time spent while satisfying all the constraints. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): If individual \\(i\\) is assigned task \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ij} = 1\\), otherwise \\(x_{ij} = 0\\). Here, \\(i\\) represents individuals (A, B, C, D, E, F), and \\(j\\) represents tasks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total time spent: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}}\\sum_{j=1}^{5} (time_{ij} \\times x_{ij})\\]\n  - This function calculates the total time spent based on the time each person takes to complete each task and whether they are assigned that task.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each person can only complete one task: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{5} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n2. Each task can only be completed by one person: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E, F\\}} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n3. Individual A must be assigned a task: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{5} x_{Aj} = 1\\]\n4. Individual D cannot be assigned task 4: \\[x_{D4} = 0\\]\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\) must be integers, as individuals cannot be assigned partial tasks.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer programming techniques to find the optimal assignment of tasks to individuals that minimizes the total time spent while satisfying all the constraints. This will provide an optimized task assignment strategy for the company.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TaskAssignment\")\n\n# Define individuals and tasks\nindividuals = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\ntasks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Define time matrix\ntime_matrix = [\n    [5, 2, 3, 15, 9, 10],\n    [5, 6, 15, 2, 4, 7],\n    [15, 5, 14, 7, 15, 6],\n    [20, 15, 18, 6, 8, 11],\n    [8, 11, 18, 10, 15, 6]\n]\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {}\nfor i in individuals:\n    for j in tasks:\n        x[i, j] = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(time_matrix[j-1][individuals.index(i)] * x[i, j] for i in individuals for j in tasks), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\n# Each person can only complete one task\nfor i in individuals:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for j in tasks) == 1, name=f\"Individual_{i}\")\n\n# Each task can only be completed by one person\nfor j in tasks:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for i in individuals) == 1, name=f\"Task_{j}\")\n\n# Individual A must be assigned a task\nmodel.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x['A', j] for j in tasks) == 1, name=\"A_must_be_assigned\")\n\n# Individual D cannot be assigned task 4\nmodel.addConstr(x['D', 4] == 0, name=\"D_not_task_4\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total time spent:\", model.objval)\n    print(\"Task assignment:\")\n    for i in individuals:\n        for j in tasks:\n            if x[i, j].x > 0.5:\n                print(f\"Individual {i} assigned to Task {j}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define the individuals, tasks, and time matrix.

What is the minimum total additional cost resulting from deviations from the optimal berthing positions and delays? (Assume vessels can only dock at integer positions on the hour.)\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the berthing problem for the container terminal, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total additional cost resulting from deviations from the optimal berthing positions and delays. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): If vessel \\(i\\) docks at position \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ij} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ij} = 0\\). Here, \\(i\\) represents the vessels (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I), and \\(j\\) represents the positions (1 to 900).\n- \\(t_i\\): The docking time of vessel \\(i\\). Here, \\(i\\) represents the vessels (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total additional cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I\\}} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{900} (additional\\_cost_{ij} \\times |j - optimal\\_position_i| \\times x_{ij}) + delay\\_cost_i \\times (t_i - arrival\\_time_i) \\right)\\]\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each vessel can only dock at one position: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{900} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n2. Each position can only be occupied by one vessel: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I\\}} x_{ij} \\leq 1, \\forall j\\]\n3. The docking time of each vessel must be greater than or equal to the arrival time and the required working time: \\[t_i \\geq arrival\\_time_i + working\\_time_i, \\forall i\\]\n4. The length of each vessel must not exceed the length of the berth: \\[length_i \\leq berth\\_length, \\forall i\\]\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\) must be integers (0 or 1) since vessels can only dock at integer positions.\n- \\(t_i\\) must be integers since docking times are in hours.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal berthing positions and docking times for each vessel, minimizing the total additional cost while satisfying the constraints of vessel lengths and berth length.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_i\\): If a transfer center is built at candidate location \\(i\\), then \\(x_i = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_i = 0\\). Where \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n- \\(y_{ij}\\): If outlet \\(j\\) is served by transfer center \\(i\\), then \\(y_{ij} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(y_{ij} = 0\\). Where \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(j = 1, 2, ..., 10\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the maximum distance from all outlets to their nearest transfer center: \\[Z = \\max \\left( \\max_{i=1}^{5} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} d_{ij} y_{ij} \\right)\\]\n  - This function aims to minimize the maximum distance from all outlets to their nearest transfer center.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each outlet can only be served by one transfer center: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{5} y_{ij} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n2. If a transfer center is not built at candidate location \\(i\\), then it cannot serve any outlets: \\[y_{ij} \\leq x_i, \\forall i, j\\]\n3. Only 2 transfer centers can be built: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i = 2\\]\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), for all \\(i\\), ensuring that the solution is discrete and follows the logic of \"either fully selected or not selected\".\n- \\(y_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), for all \\(i, j\\), ensuring that the solution is discrete and follows the logic of \"either fully selected or not selected\".\n\nUsing this model, we can apply mixed integer programming techniques to find out how to select the locations of the transfer centers and assign outlets to them in order to minimize the maximum distance from all outlets to their nearest transfer center. This will provide the company with an optimal strategy for constructing transfer centers and serving outlets.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogisticsCenterOptimization\")\n\n# Define parameters\nnum_locations = 5\nnum_outlets = 10\nnum_centers = 2\n\n# Distance matrix\ndistances = [\n    [15, 22, 30, 45, 50, 12, 28, 35, 40, 25],\n    [10, 18, 25, 35, 40, 8, 20, 28, 32, 18],\n    [25, 30, 35, 50, 55, 22, 32, 40, 45, 30],\n    [30, 35, 40, 55, 60, 25, 35, 45, 50, 35],\n    [5, 12, 20, 30, 35, 5, 15, 22, 28, 12]\n]\n\n# Create decision variables\nx = [model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}\") for i in range(num_locations)]\ny = [[model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"y_{i}_{j}\") for j in range(num_outlets)] for i in range(num_locations)]\n\n# Add constraints\n# Each outlet can only be served by one transfer center\nfor j in range(num_outlets):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(y[i][j] for i in range(num_locations)) == 1)\n\n# If a transfer center is not built at candidate location i, then it cannot serve any outlets\nfor i in range(num_locations):\n    for j in range(num_outlets):\n        model.addConstr(y[i][j] <= x[i])\n\n# Only 2 transfer centers can be built\nmodel.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i] for i in range(num_locations)) == num_centers)\n\n# Define objective function\nmax_distance = model.addVar(name=\"max_distance\")\nfor i in range(num_locations):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(distances[i][j] * y[i][j] for j in range(num_outlets)) <= max_distance)\n\nmodel.setObjective(max_distance, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum possible value of the maximum distance from all outlets to their nearest transfer center: {model.objval}\")\n    print(\"Selected transfer center locations:\")\n    for i in range(num_locations):\n        if x[i].x > 0.5:\n            print(f\"Location {i+1}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first defines the parameters of the problem, including the number of candidate locations, the number of outlets, the number of transfer centers to be built, and the distance matrix. Then, it creates two decision variables: `x` represents whether a transfer center is built at each candidate location, and `y` represents whether each outlet is served by each transfer center.\n\nNext, the script adds three constraints: each outlet can only be served by one transfer center, if a transfer center is not built at a candidate location, it cannot serve any outlets, and only 2 transfer centers can be built.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize the maximum distance from all outlets to their nearest transfer center. To achieve this, the script introduces a new variable `max_distance` and adds constraints for each transfer center to ensure that its service distance does not exceed `max_distance`.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the optimal solution (if found).

Truck return to the logistics center: \\[\\sum_{j} x_{j0k} = 1, \\forall k\\]\n   - This constraint ensures that each truck returns to the logistics center after completing the delivery.\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x_{ijk}\\) must be integers (0 or 1) since trucks either travel directly from one customer point to another or not.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal delivery routes for each truck, minimizing the total driving distance while meeting all customer demands and the truck capacity constraint.

Then, it creates a `coptpy` model and defines the decision variables `x[i, j, k]`, which represent whether truck `k` travels directly from customer point `i` to customer point `j`.\n\nNext, the script sets the objective function, which is to minimize the total driving distance. It then adds four constraints: each customer point can only be visited once, each truck can only visit one customer point at a time, truck capacity constraint, and truck return to the logistics center.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the shortest total driving distance and the delivery routes for each truck (if an optimal solution is found).\n\nNote that this script assumes you have installed the `coptpy` library and have a solver available.

What is the minimum number of trucks needed to meet the transportation requirements?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the logistics company's goods loading problem, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the number of trucks used while satisfying the weight and thickness capacity constraints of each truck and the transportation requirements of all goods. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): Whether the \\(i\\)th piece of goods is loaded on the \\(j\\)th truck, where \\(i\\) represents the goods (1 to 100) and \\(j\\) represents the trucks (1 to 12). If the \\(i\\)th piece of goods is loaded on the \\(j\\)th truck, \\(x_{ij} = 1\\), otherwise \\(x_{ij} = 0\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the number of trucks used: \\[Z = \\max_{j=1}^{12} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{ij}\\right)\\]\n  - This function calculates the number of trucks used and attempts to minimize this number.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each piece of goods can only be loaded on one truck: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{12} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n2. The total weight of each truck should not exceed 10 tons: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (weight_i \\cdot x_{ij}) \\leq 10000, \\forall j\\]\n3. The total thickness of each truck should not exceed 5 meters: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (thickness_i \\cdot x_{ij}) \\leq 500, \\forall j\\]\n4. The weight difference of goods on both sides of the truck should not exceed 500 kg: \\[\\left| \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (weight_i \\cdot x_{ij}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (weight_i \\cdot x_{i,j+1}) \\right| \\leq 500, \\forall j\\]\n   - This constraint needs to be applied to the last truck as well, i.e., \\(j+1\\) should be modulo 12.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), for all \\(i, j\\), ensuring that the solution is discrete and follows the logic of \"either fully selected or not selected\".\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer programming techniques (specifically 0-1 integer programming) to find out how to load the goods to minimize the number of trucks used while satisfying all the constraints. This will provide the logistics company with an optimal goods loading strategy to improve transportation efficiency.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the logistics company's goods loading problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogisticsLoading\")\n\n# Define parameters\nnum_goods = 100\nnum_trucks = 12\ngoods_thickness = [108, 62, 121, 31, 37, 90, 49, 49, 53, 156, 37, 62, 85, 78, 110, 119, 58, 159, 62, 150, 97, 131, 88, 89, 146, 50, 69, 58, 106, 138, 105, 95, 131, 38, 38, 92, 41, 40, 76, 133, 101, 103, 82, 134, 36, 126, 73, 121, 30, 116, 104, 140, 116, 74, 59, 66, 80, 64, 124, 100, 65, 47, 96, 83, 146, 139, 36, 47, 58, 133, 93, 60, 41, 38, 105, 31, 119, 115, 98, 93, 37, 90, 121, 83, 92, 36, 32, 56, 74, 126, 117, 72, 43, 38, 78, 65, 112, 149, 33, 88]\ngoods_weight = [469, 301, 673, 239, 451, 723, 513, 417, 397, 1715, 261, 578, 916, 736, 1024, 634, 346, 1038, 428, 1008, 709, 1396, 876, 694, 737, 398, 656, 356, 1165, 1112, 729, 1070, 1015, 224, 437, 917, 273, 303, 614, 738, 1069, 636, 686, 1035, 188, 1103, 647, 1269, 271, 1234, 631, 1577, 1201, 614, 435, 564, 695, 375, 1541, 693, 413, 270, 482, 979, 1461, 1251, 329, 389, 606, 1491, 445, 493, 357, 403, 706, 196, 1405, 571, 1097, 872, 279, 581, 973, 814, 585, 221, 235, 664, 817, 929, 951, 509, 434, 339, 525, 499, 1250, 1419, 140, 720]\n\n# Define decision variables\nx = {}\nfor i in range(num_goods):\n    for j in range(num_trucks):\n        x[i, j] = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for i in range(num_goods) for j in range(num_trucks)), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\n# Each piece of goods can only be loaded on one truck\nfor i in range(num_goods):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for j in range(num_trucks)) == 1, name=f\"Goods_{i}\")\n\n# The total weight of each truck should not exceed 10 tons\nfor j in range(num_trucks):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(goods_weight[i] * x[i, j] for i in range(num_goods)) <= 10000, name=f\"Weight_{j}\")\n\n# The total thickness of each truck should not exceed 5 meters\nfor j in range(num_trucks):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(goods_thickness[i] * x[i, j] for i in range(num_goods)) <= 500, name=f\"Thickness_{j}\")\n\n# The weight difference of goods on both sides of the truck should not exceed 500 kg\nfor j in range(num_trucks):\n    model.addConstr(cp.abs(cp.quicksum(goods_weight[i] * x[i, j] for i in range(num_goods)) - cp.quicksum(goods_weight[i] * x[i, (j+1) % num_trucks] for i in range(num_goods))) <= 500, name=f\"WeightBalance_{j}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum number of trucks needed:\", model.objval)\n    print(\"Truck loading plan:\")\n    for j in range(num_trucks):\n        print(f\"Truck {j+1}:\")\n        for i in range(num_goods):\n            if x[i, j].x > 0.5:\n                print(f\"    Goods {i+1}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script uses the `coptpy` library to model and solve the logistics company's goods loading problem.

Under these conditions, what is the shortest total travel distance for the trucks? (The distance between two points is calculated as the straight-line distance.)\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the delivery problem for the urban delivery company, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total travel distance for the trucks while satisfying the delivery requirements and truck capacity constraints. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ijk}\\): If truck \\(k\\) travels directly from distribution center \\(i\\) to customer \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ijk} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ijk} = 0\\).\n- \\(y_{kl}\\): If truck \\(k\\) returns to distribution center \\(l\\), then \\(y_{kl} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(y_{kl} = 0\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total travel distance: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B\\}} \\sum_{j \\in \\{customer locations\\}} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\sum_{l \\in \\{A, B\\}} (distance_{ij} \\times x_{ijk} + distance_{jl} \\times y_{kl})\\]\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each customer must be visited exactly once: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B\\}} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n2. Each truck must depart from its assigned distribution center and return to the same distribution center: \\[\\sum_{j \\in \\{customer locations\\}} x_{ijk} = \\sum_{j \\in \\{customer locations\\}} y_{kl}, \\forall i, k, l\\]\n3.

To prevent sub-cycles, the script uses the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) constraint, adding additional variables `u` and corresponding constraints.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the shortest travel distance and the optimal route. If an optimal solution is found, it prints the shortest travel distance and the sequence of communities visited by the vehicle.\n\nNote that this script assumes the vehicle starts from community C1.

What is the shortest travel distance? (Distances are calculated as straight-line distances in kilometers.)\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the mobile medical vehicle, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total travel distance while satisfying the time window constraints for each community and the constraint of returning to the Central City Hospital. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): If the medical vehicle travels directly from community \\(i\\) to community \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ij} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ij} = 0\\). Here, \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) represent the community IDs (C1, C2, ..., C10).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total travel distance: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{C1, C2, ..., C10\\}}\\sum_{j \\in \\{C1, C2, ..., C10\\}} (distance_{ij} \\times x_{ij})\\]\n  - This function calculates the total travel distance based on the distance between each pair of communities and the decision variables.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each community can only be visited once: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{C1, C2, ..., C10\\}} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n   - This ensures that each community is visited only once.\n2. Each community can only be left once: \\[\\sum_{j \\in \\{C1, C2, ..., C10\\}} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n   - This ensures that each community is left only once.\n3.

Return to the Central City Hospital: \\[x_{C1,j} = 1, \\text{for some } j\\]\n   - This ensures that the medical vehicle returns to the Central City Hospital after visiting all communities.\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\) must be integers (0 or 1) since the medical vehicle either travels directly from community \\(i\\) to community \\(j\\) or not.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal route for the medical vehicle that minimizes the total travel distance while satisfying the time window constraints for each community and the constraint of returning to the Central City Hospital.

Each supermarket has a specified time window for receiving goods and a specified unloading time. The distribution center has 5 identical refrigerated trucks, each with a maximum load of 3 tons and a speed of 40 km/h. The coordinates of the distribution center are (0, 0), and the information of the supermarkets is as follows:\n\n| SUPERMARKET ID | (x,y) | DEMAND(kg) | TIME WINDOW | UNLOADING TIME(min) |\n|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| S1      | (-5, 4)   | 800        | [7:00-9:00]  | 20           |\n| S2      | (3, 6)    | 600        | [8:00-10:00] | 15           |\n| S3      | (-2, -3)  | 900        | [7:30-9:30]  | 25           |\n| S4      | (4, -2)   | 700        | [8:30-10:30] | 20           |\n| S5      | (-4, -5)  | 500        | [9:00-11:00] | 15           |\n| S6      | (6, 3)    | 850        | [7:00-9:00]  | 25           |\n| S7      | (-3, 5)   | 750        | [8:00-10:00] | 20           |\n| S8      | (5, -4)   | 600        | [9:30-11:30] | 15           |\n| S9      | (-6, -2)  | 450        | [8:00-10:00] | 15           |\n| S10     | (2, 7)    | 800        | [7:30-9:30]  | 20           |\n| S11     | (-1, -6)  | 550        | [9:00-11:00] | 15           |\n| S12     | (4, 5)    | 700        | [8:30-10:30] | 20           |\n\nThe 5 refrigerated trucks leave the distribution center after 6:30 AM to deliver fresh products to the designated supermarkets and must return to the distribution center before 12:00 PM. What is the shortest total travel distance for the refrigerated trucks? (Distances are calculated as straight-line distances in kilometers.)\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the delivery problem for the fresh food e-commerce platform, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total travel distance for the refrigerated trucks while satisfying the time windows and unloading time constraints for each supermarket. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ijk}\\): If refrigerated truck \\(i\\) travels directly from supermarket \\(j\\) to supermarket \\(k\\), then \\(x_{ijk} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ijk} = 0\\). Here, \\(i\\) represents the refrigerated truck (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) represent the supermarkets (S1, S2, ..., S12).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total travel distance: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{5}\\sum_{j=1}^{12}\\sum_{k=1, k\\neq j}^{12} (distance_{jk} \\times x_{ijk})\\]\n  - This function calculates the total travel distance based on the travel distance from each supermarket to each supermarket and the decision variables.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each supermarket can only be visited by one refrigerated truck: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{5}\\sum_{k=1, k\\neq j}^{12} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n2. Each refrigerated truck can only visit each supermarket once: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{12}\\sum_{k=1, k\\neq j}^{12} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall i\\]\n3. Time window constraints: The refrigerated trucks must arrive at each supermarket within the specified time window.\n4. Unloading time constraints: The refrigerated trucks must stay at each supermarket for the specified unloading time.\n5. Refrigerated truck return time constraint: The refrigerated trucks must return to the distribution center before 12:00 PM.\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ijk}\\) must be integers (0 or 1) since the refrigerated trucks either travel directly from one supermarket to another or do not.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal delivery routes for the refrigerated trucks, minimizing the total travel distance while satisfying the time windows and unloading time constraints for each supermarket. This will provide the fresh food e-commerce platform with an economically efficient delivery strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the delivery problem for the fresh food e-commerce platform:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\nimport math\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FreshFoodDelivery\")\n\n# Define parameters\nnum_trucks = 5\nnum_supermarkets = 12\nmax_load = 3  # Maximum load of refrigerated trucks (tons)\ntruck_speed = 40  # Speed of refrigerated trucks (km/h)\ntime_horizon = 5.5  # Time horizon (hours)\n\n# Supermarket information\nsupermarket_coords = {\n    'S1': (-5, 4), 'S2': (3, 6), 'S3': (-2, -3), 'S4': (4, -2),\n    'S5': (-4, -5), 'S6': (6, 3), 'S7': (-3, 5), 'S8': (5, -4),\n    'S9': (-6, -2), 'S10': (2, 7), 'S11': (-1, -6), 'S12': (4, 5)\n}\nsupermarket_demands = {\n    'S1': 800, 'S2': 600, 'S3': 900, 'S4': 700, 'S5': 500,\n    'S6': 850, 'S7': 750, 'S8': 600, 'S9': 450, 'S10': 800,\n    'S11': 550, 'S12': 700\n}\nsupermarket_time_windows = {\n    'S1': (7, 9), 'S2': (8, 10), 'S3': (7.5, 9.5),\n    'S4': (8.5, 10.5), 'S5': (9, 11),\n    'S6': (7, 9), 'S7': (8, 10), 'S8': (9.5, 11.5),\n    'S9': (8, 10), 'S10': (7.5, 9.5),\n    'S11': (9, 11), 'S12': (8.5, 10.5)\n}\nsupermarket_unloading_times = {\n    'S1': 20, 'S2': 15, 'S3': 25, 'S4': 20, 'S5': 15,\n    'S6': 25, 'S7': 20, 'S8': 15, 'S9': 15, 'S10': 20,\n    'S11': 15, 'S12': 20\n}\n\n# Calculate distance matrix\ndist_matrix = {}\nfor i in range(num_supermarkets):\n    for j in range(num_supermarkets):\n        if i != j:\n            dist_matrix[i, j] = math.sqrt((supermarket_coords[f'S{i+1}'][0] - supermarket_coords[f'S{j+1}'][0])**2 +\n                                         (supermarket_coords[f'S{i+1}'][1] - supermarket_coords[f'S{j+1}'][1])**2)\n\n# Create decision variables\nx = {(i, j, k): model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}_{k}\")\n     for i in range(1, num_trucks+1) for j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k}\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(dist_matrix[j, k] * x[i, j, k] for i in range(1, num_trucks+1)\n                               for j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\n# Each supermarket can only be visited by one refrigerated truck\nfor j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] for i in range(1, num_trucks+1) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k) == 1,\n                    name=f\"Visit_{j}\")\n\n# Each refrigerated truck can only visit each supermarket once\nfor i in range(1, num_trucks+1):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] for j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k) == 1,\n                    name=f\"Truck_{i}\")\n\n# Time window constraints\nfor j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1):\n    for i in range(1, num_trucks+1):\n        model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] * (supermarket_time_windows[f'S{j}'][0] + 0.5) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k) >= supermarket_time_windows[f'S{j}'][0],\n                        name=f\"TimeWindowStart_{i}_{j}\")\n        model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] * (supermarket_time_windows[f'S{j}'][1] - supermarket_unloading_times[f'S{j}']) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k) <= supermarket_time_windows[f'S{j}'][1] - supermarket_unloading_times[f'S{j}'],\n                        name=f\"TimeWindowEnd_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Refrigerated truck return time constraint\nfor i in range(1, num_trucks+1):\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j, k] * (dist_matrix[j, k] / truck_speed + 0.5) for j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1) if j != k) + (time_horizon - 1) <= time_horizon,\n                    name=f\"ReturnTime_{i}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Shortest total travel distance: {round(model.objval, 2)} km\")\n    for i in range(1, num_trucks+1):\n        print(f\"Delivery route for refrigerated truck {i}:\")\n        for j in range(1, num_supermarkets+1):\n            for k in range(1, num_supermarkets+1):\n                if j != k and x[i, j, k].x > 0.5:\n                    print(f\"  From supermarket {j} to supermarket {k}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script defines the parameters of the problem, including the number of refrigerated trucks, the number of supermarkets, the maximum load, the speed, and the time horizon. It then creates a distance matrix based on the coordinates of the supermarkets.\n\nNext, the script defines the decision variables `x[i, j, k]`, which represent whether refrigerated truck `i` travels directly from supermarket `j` to supermarket `k`.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize the total travel distance, calculated by multiplying the distance from each supermarket to each supermarket by the corresponding decision variables and summing them up.\n\nThe constraints include:\n1. Each supermarket can only be visited by one refrigerated truck.\n2. Each refrigerated truck can only visit each supermarket once.\n3.

How should the routes be planned to minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks? (Distances are calculated as straight-line distances.)\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this delivery problem, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks while satisfying the pickup and delivery time windows for each order and the load limit of the trucks. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ijk}\\): If truck \\(k\\) travels directly from customer \\(i\\) to customer \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ijk} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ijk} = 0\\). Here, \\(i, j\\) represent customers (including the depot), and \\(k\\) represents trucks.\n- \\(t_{ik}\\): The time when truck \\(k\\) arrives at customer \\(i\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total distance traveled: \\[Z = \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\sum_{k} d_{ij} \\cdot x_{ijk}\\]\n  - This function calculates the total distance traveled by all trucks from one customer to another.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each customer can only be served by one truck: \\[\\sum_{i}\\sum_{k} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n2. Each truck can only serve one customer at a time: \\[\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall k\\]\n3. The load limit of the trucks: \\[\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\sum_{k} w_{j} \\cdot x_{ijk} \\leq 1000, \\forall k\\]\n   - Here, \\(w_{j}\\) is the weight of customer \\(j\\).\n4. The pickup and delivery time windows for each order: \\[t_{ik} + s_{i} + d_{ij} \\leq t_{jk}, \\forall i, j, k\\]\n   - Here, \\(s_{i}\\) is the service time at customer \\(i\\), and \\(d_{ij}\\) is the distance from customer \\(i\\) to customer \\(j\\).\n5. The trucks must return to the depot: \\[\\sum_{i} x_{0ik} = 1, \\forall k\\]\n   - Here, 0 represents the depot.\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ijk} \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), for all \\(i, j, k\\), to ensure that the solution is discrete and follows the logic of \"either fully selected or not selected\".\n- \\(t_{ik} \\geq 0\\), for all \\(i, k\\), to ensure that the arrival times are non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer programming (specifically, 0-1 integer programming) techniques to find out how to plan the routes to minimize the total distance traveled by the trucks while satisfying all the constraints.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\nDefine a three-dimensional decision variable \\(x_{ijk}\\), where \\(i\\) represents the order (\\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\)), \\(j\\) represents the processing step (\\(j = 1, 2, 3\\)), and \\(k\\) represents the machine (\\(k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\)). If order \\(i\\) performs step \\(j\\) on machine \\(k\\), then \\(x_{ijk} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ijk} = 0\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total completion time for all tasks: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\left( t_{ijk} \\cdot x_{ijk} \\right)\\]\n  - This function calculates the total completion time for all tasks, where \\(t_{ijk}\\) is the time required for order \\(i\\) to perform step \\(j\\) on machine \\(k\\).\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

Each machine can only process one task at a time: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_{ijk} \\leq 1, \\forall k\\]\n3.

What is the maximum achievable profit?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the commodities trader, we will establish a mathematical model to maximize the total profit from buying and selling platinum over the six quarters, while considering the constraints of the vault's capacity and the inventory dynamics. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(s_t\\): The amount of platinum sold in quarter \\(t\\).\n- \\(b_t\\): The amount of platinum purchased in quarter \\(t\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total profit: \\[Z = \\sum_{t=1}^{6} (Selling Price_t \\times s_t - Purchase Price_t \\times b_t)\\]\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Inventory dynamics: For each quarter \\(t\\), the inventory level is equal to the previous quarter's inventory plus the purchase quantity minus the sales quantity. The initial inventory is 150 kilograms.\n   - \\(150 + \\sum_{k=1}^{t-1} b_k - \\sum_{k=1}^{t-1} s_k + b_t - s_t \\leq 500, \\forall t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\n2. Sales quantity cannot exceed inventory: For each quarter \\(t\\), the sales quantity cannot exceed the current inventory.\n   - \\(s_t \\leq 150 + \\sum_{k=1}^{t-1} b_k - \\sum_{k=1}^{t-1} s_k, \\forall t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: All sales and purchase quantities must be non-negative.\n   - \\(s_t, b_t \\geq 0, \\forall t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\n\n### Integer Constraints:\n- \\(s_t, b_t\\) must be integers, as the quantity of platinum cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal sales and purchase quantities for each quarter, maximizing total profit while satisfying the constraints of the vault's capacity and inventory dynamics. This will provide the trader with an optimized strategy for buying and selling platinum over the six quarters.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the commodities trader:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"CommodityTraderOptimization\")\n\n# Define parameters\nnum_quarters = 6\nmax_capacity = 500\ninitial_inventory = 150\nselling_prices = [30000, 35000, 40000, 36000, 38000, 42000]\npurchase_prices = [32000, 36000, 38000, 33000, 39000, 40000]\n\n# Add decision variables\ns = [model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=f\"s_{t}\") for t in range(1, num_quarters+1)]  # Sales quantity\nb = [model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=f\"b_{t}\") for t in range(1, num_quarters+1)]  # Purchase quantity\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(selling_prices[t-1] * s[t-1] - purchase_prices[t-1] * b[t-1] for t in range(1, num_quarters+1)), sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Inventory dynamics\nfor t in range(1, num_quarters+1):\n    model.addConstr(initial_inventory + cp.quicksum(b[k-1] - s[k-1] for k in range(1, t)) + b[t-1] - s[t-1] <= max_capacity, name=f\"InventoryBalance_{t}\")\n\n# Sales quantity cannot exceed inventory\nfor t in range(1, num_quarters+1):\n    model.addConstr(s[t-1] <= initial_inventory + cp.quicksum(b[k-1] - s[k-1] for k in range(1, t)), name=f\"SalesLimit_{t}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximum total profit: ${model.objval:.2f}\")\n    for t in range(1, num_quarters+1):\n        print(f\"Quarter {t}: Sales = {s[t-1].x} kg, Purchase = {b[t-1].x} kg\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first defines the parameters of the problem, such as the number of quarters, the maximum capacity of the vault, the initial inventory, and the selling and purchase prices for each quarter. Then, it creates decision variables for the sales and purchase quantities for each quarter.\n\nThe objective function is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the sales revenue minus the purchase cost for each quarter.\n\nThe constraints include the inventory dynamics, which ensure that the inventory level at the end of each quarter does not exceed the maximum capacity of the vault, and the sales quantity cannot exceed the current inventory.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the maximum total profit and the optimal sales and purchase quantities for each quarter (if an optimal solution is found).\n\nNote that this script assumes you have installed the `coptpy` library and have an available COPT solver.

The cost of printing one copy is $2 during regular working hours (RT) and $3 during overtime (OT). Each month, regular-time production is limited to 6,000 copies, and overtime production is limited to 2,000 copies. Additionally, the inventory holding cost is $0.5 per copy per month. What is the minimum total cost to meet the demand for the next six months on time?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the publishing company's printing strategy problem, we need to construct a linear programming model to minimize the total cost while meeting the monthly demand and production constraints.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): The quantity of products transported from distribution center \\(i\\) to fulfillment hub \\(j\\). Where \\(i\\) represents the distribution center (1, 2, 3), and \\(j\\) represents the fulfillment hub (1, 2, 3).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total transportation distance: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\sum_{j=1}^{3} (distance_{ij} \\times x_{ij})\\]\n  - This function calculates the total transportation distance based on the quantity of products transported from each distribution center to each fulfillment hub and the corresponding transportation distance.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Inventory requirements of the fulfillment hubs: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{ij} = 300, \\forall j\\]\n   - This ensures that each fulfillment hub has exactly 300 products in total inventory.\n2. Corporate policy requirement for the same number of premium products in each fulfillment hub: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_{ij} \\times premium\\_ratio_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_{ik} \\times premium\\_ratio_i), \\forall j, k\\]\n   - This ensures that each fulfillment hub stocks the same number of premium products to ensure consistent customer experience across all locations.\n3. Distribution center inventory limits: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{3} x_{ij} \\leq inventory_i, \\forall i\\]\n   - This ensures that the total quantity of products shipped from each distribution center does not exceed its inventory.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ij} \\geq 0, \\forall i, j\\)\n   - This ensures that the quantity of products transported from each distribution center to each fulfillment hub is non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal quantity of products transported from each distribution center to each fulfillment hub, minimizing the total transportation distance while satisfying the inventory requirements of the fulfillment hubs and the corporate policy. This will provide the national e-commerce company with an economically efficient product allocation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the national e-commerce company:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"NationalEcommerceOptimization\")\n\n# Distribution center inventory\ninventory = {1: 150 + 30, 2: 250 + 100, 3: 300 + 70}\n\n# Fulfillment hub inventory requirements\ndemand = {1: 300, 2: 300, 3: 300}\n\n# Transportation distances\ndistances = {\n    1: {1: 0, 2: 12, 3: 18},\n    2: {1: 12, 2: 0, 3: 15},\n    3: {1: 18, 2: 15, 3: 0}\n}\n\n# Premium product ratio\npremium_ratio = {1: 0.16666666666666666, 2: 0.2857142857142857, 3: 0.19047619047619047}\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {(i, j): model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}\") for i in inventory for j in demand}\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(distances[i][j] * x[i, j] for i in inventory for j in demand), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\n# Fulfillment hub inventory requirements\nfor j in demand:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for i in inventory) == demand[j], name=f\"Demand_{j}\")\n\n# Corporate policy requirement for the same number of premium products in each fulfillment hub\nfor j in demand:\n    for k in demand:\n        if j != k:\n            model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] * premium_ratio[i] for i in inventory) ==\n                            cp.quicksum(x[i, k] * premium_ratio[i] for i in inventory), name=f\"Premium_{j}_{k}\")\n\n# Distribution center inventory limits\nfor i in inventory:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for j in demand) <= inventory[i], name=f\"Inventory_{i}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total transportation distance: {:.2f} kilometers\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Product allocation scheme:\")\n    for i in inventory:\n        for j in demand:\n            if x[i, j].x > 0:\n                print(f\"Quantity of products transported from distribution center {i} to fulfillment hub {j}: {x[i, j].x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define the input data for the problem, including the inventory of distribution centers, the inventory requirements of fulfillment hubs, transportation distances, and the premium product ratio. Then, it creates a `coptpy` model and adds decision variables `x[i, j]` representing the quantity of products transported from distribution center `i` to fulfillment hub `j`.\n\nNext, the script sets the objective function to minimize the total transportation distance and adds constraints to ensure the fulfillment hub inventory requirements, the corporate policy requirement for the same number of premium products in each fulfillment hub, and the distribution center inventory limits.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the minimum total transportation distance and the product allocation scheme (if an optimal solution is found).\n\nNote that this script assumes you have already installed the `coptpy` library.

Formulate and solve a shortest-path problem whose solution will minimize the cost of meeting the demand for food containers.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the company's food container production problem, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total cost of meeting the demand for all container types. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_i\\): The quantity of the \\(i\\)th container type produced, where \\(i\\) represents the container type (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{7} (variable\\_cost_i \\times x_i + fixed\\_cost_i)\\]\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the quantity of each container type produced and their respective variable and fixed costs.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Meet the demand for each container type: \\[x_i \\geq demand_i, \\forall i\\]\n   - This ensures that the quantity of each container type produced meets or exceeds the demand.\n\n### Non-negativity Constraints:\n- \\(x_i \\geq 0, \\forall i\\), and must be integers since the quantity of containers cannot be negative or fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal quantities of each container type to produce, minimizing the total cost while meeting the demand for all container types. This will provide the company with an economically efficient production strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the food container production problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FoodContainerProduction\")\n\n# Container types, volumes, and demands\ncontainer_types = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nvolumes = {1: 17, 2: 19, 3: 21, 4: 23, 5: 25, 6: 29, 7: 33}\ndemands = {1: 500, 2: 400, 3: 300, 4: 250, 5: 200, 6: 150, 7: 100}\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {i: model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=f\"x_{i}\") for i in container_types}\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total cost\nvariable_cost = {i: volumes[i] for i in container_types}\nfixed_cost = 1000\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(variable_cost[i] * x[i] + fixed_cost for i in container_types), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints: Meet the demand for each container type\nfor i in container_types:\n    model.addConstr(x[i] >= demands[i], name=f\"Demand_{i}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total cost: {:.2f} dollars\".format(model.objval))\n    for i in container_types:\n        print(f\"Quantity of container type {i} produced: {x[i].x} units\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we define the container types, volumes, and demands.\n\n3. We add an integer decision variable `x[i]` for each container type, representing the quantity of the `i`th container type produced.\n\n4. The objective function is to minimize the total cost, including the variable cost and fixed cost. The variable cost is the volume of each container type multiplied by its production quantity, and the fixed cost is $1,000 for each container type.\n\n5. Constraints ensure that the quantity of each container type produced meets or exceeds the demand.\n\n6. We solve the model and output the minimum total cost and the optimal production quantities for each container type.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the food container production problem, minimizing the total cost while meeting the demand for all container types.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"FoodContainerProduction\")\n\n# Container types, volumes, and demands\ncontainer_types = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nvolumes = {1: 17, 2: 19, 3: 21, 4: 23, 5: 25, 6: 29, 7: 33}\ndemands = {1: 500, 2: 400, 3: 300, 4: 250, 5: 200, 6: 150, 7: 100}\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {i: model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=f\"x_{i}\") for i in container_types}\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total cost\nvariable_cost = {i: volumes[i] for i in container_types}\nfixed_cost = 1000\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(variable_cost[i] * x[i] + fixed_cost for i in container_types), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints: Meet the demand for each container type\nfor i in container_types:\n    model.addConstr(x[i] >= demands[i], name=f\"Demand_{i}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total cost: {:.2f} dollars\".format(model.objval))\n    for i in container_types:\n        print(f\"Quantity of container type {i} produced: {x[i].x} units\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": true, "execution_success": true, "mathematical_accuracy": true, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "2025-09-24 09:50:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.2.11 20250801\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/miniconda3/envs/orlm/bin\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/qua/copt\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

How to minimize the total cost of meeting weekly shipment demands?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for LogiTrans, we will establish a linear programming model focused on minimizing the total cost of operating the distribution centers while meeting the shipment demands. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(y_1\\): Whether distribution center 1 is activated (1 = activated, 0 = not activated).\n- \\(y_2\\): Whether distribution center 2 is activated (1 = activated, 0 = not activated).\n- \\(x_1\\): Number of coordinators at distribution center 1.\n- \\(x_2\\): Number of coordinators at distribution center 2.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total cost: \\(Z = 1000y_1 + 2000y_2 + 500x_1 + 900x_2\\)\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the fixed costs of activating the distribution centers and the salaries of the coordinators.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Shipment demands for goods type 1, 2, and 3 are met:\n   - \\(20x_1 + 25x_2 \\geq 120\\) (Type 1)\n   - \\(18x_1 + 22x_2 \\geq 150\\) (Type 2)\n   - \\(15x_1 + 20x_2 \\geq 200\\) (Type 3)\n2. Limit on the number of coordinators at distribution center 1:\n   - \\(x_1 \\leq 7y_1\\)\n3. Limit on the number of coordinators at distribution center 2:\n   - \\(x_2 \\leq 7y_2\\)\n4. Binary constraints on the activation of distribution centers:\n   - \\(y_1, y_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\)\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2 \\geq 0\\)\n\n### Integer constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2\\) must be integers, as the number of coordinators cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of coordinators at each distribution center and whether each distribution center should be activated, in order to minimize the total cost while meeting the shipment demands. This will provide LogiTrans with an economically efficient strategy for allocating its logistics resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for LogiTrans:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for LogiTrans\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogiTransOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\ny1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=\"y1\")  # Whether distribution center 1 is activated\ny2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=\"y2\")  # Whether distribution center 2 is activated\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of coordinators at distribution center 1\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of coordinators at distribution center 2\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20*x1 + 25*x2 >= 120, name=\"DemandType1\")  # Shipment demand for goods type 1\nmodel.addConstr(18*x1 + 22*x2 >= 150, name=\"DemandType2\")  # Shipment demand for goods type 2\nmodel.addConstr(15*x1 + 20*x2 >= 200, name=\"DemandType3\")  # Shipment demand for goods type 3\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 7*y1, name=\"Center1Capacity\")  # Limit on the number of coordinators at distribution center 1\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 7*y2, name=\"Center2Capacity\")  # Limit on the number of coordinators at distribution center 2\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total cost\nmodel.setObjective(1000*y1 + 2000*y2 + 500*x1 + 900*x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total cost: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of coordinators at distribution center 1: {x1.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of coordinators at distribution center 2: {x2.x}\")\n    print(f\"Is distribution center 1 activated: {'Yes' if y1.x > 0.5 else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"Is distribution center 2 activated: {'Yes' if y2.x > 0.5 else 'No'}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first creates a COPT environment and model. Then, it defines the decision variables `y1`, `y2`, `x1`, and `x2`, representing whether each distribution center is activated and the number of coordinators at each distribution center.\n\nNext, the script adds constraints to ensure that the shipment demands for each type of goods are met and that the number of coordinators at each distribution center does not exceed its capacity.\n\nThe objective function is set to minimize the total cost, including the fixed costs of activating the distribution centers and the salaries of the coordinators.\n\nFinally, the model is solved, and if an optimal solution is found, the script prints the minimum total cost, the number of coordinators at each distribution center, and whether each distribution center is activated. If no optimal solution is found, the script prints the corresponding message.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for LogiTrans using the `coptpy` library, finding the optimal strategy for allocating its logistics resources to minimize the total cost while meeting the shipment demands.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for LogiTrans\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogiTransOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\ny1 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=\"y1\")  # Whether distribution center 1 is activated\ny2 = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=\"y2\")  # Whether distribution center 2 is activated\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x1\")  # Number of coordinators at distribution center 1\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x2\")  # Number of coordinators at distribution center 2\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(20*x1 + 25*x2 >= 120, name=\"DemandType1\")  # Shipment demand for goods type 1\nmodel.addConstr(18*x1 + 22*x2 >= 150, name=\"DemandType2\")  # Shipment demand for goods type 2\nmodel.addConstr(15*x1 + 20*x2 >= 200, name=\"DemandType3\")  # Shipment demand for goods type 3\nmodel.addConstr(x1 <= 7*y1, name=\"Center1Capacity\")  # Limit on the number of coordinators at distribution center 1\nmodel.addConstr(x2 <= 7*y2, name=\"Center2Capacity\")  # Limit on the number of coordinators at distribution center 2\n\n# Set the objective function to minimize total cost\nmodel.setObjective(1000*y1 + 2000*y2 + 500*x1 + 900*x2, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Minimum total cost: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of coordinators at distribution center 1: {x1.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of coordinators at distribution center 2: {x2.x}\")\n    print(f\"Is distribution center 1 activated: {'Yes' if y1.x > 0.5 else 'No'}\")\n    print(f\"Is distribution center 2 activated: {'Yes' if y2.x > 0.5 else 'No'}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": true, "execution_success": true, "mathematical_accuracy": true, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "2025-09-24 09:50:56 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.2.11 20250801\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/miniconda3/envs/orlm/bin\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/qua/copt\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2025-09-24 09:50:56 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

Each dollar spent on marketing bioethanol generates 8 liters of demand, and each dollar spent on marketing biodiesel generates 15 liters of demand. Bioethanol is sold for $30 per liter, and biodiesel is sold for $25 per liter. Help Green Energy Solutions maximize its profit. Assume that the company cannot purchase additional feedstock of either type.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo help Green Energy Solutions maximize its profit, we need to construct a linear programming model to determine the optimal production and marketing strategies for bioethanol and biodiesel. Here is the detailed formulation of the model:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1\\): The amount of bioethanol produced (in liters).\n- \\(x_2\\): The amount of biodiesel produced (in liters).\n- \\(y_1\\): The amount of marketing dollars spent on bioethanol.\n- \\(y_2\\): The amount of marketing dollars spent on biodiesel.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total profit: \\[Z = 30 \\times 8 \\times y_1 + 25 \\times 15 \\times y_2 - 12 \\times x_1 - 6 \\times x_2\\]\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the sales revenue and production costs of each product.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Feedstock A usage constraint: \\[x_1 + 0.8x_2 \\leq 8000\\]\n   - This ensures that the total amount of feedstock A used for producing bioethanol and biodiesel does not exceed 8,000 liters.\n2. Feedstock B usage constraint: \\[0.2x_1 + x_2 \\leq 12000\\]\n   - This ensures that the total amount of feedstock B used for producing bioethanol and biodiesel does not exceed 12,000 liters.\n3. Bioethanol quality rating constraint: \\[\\frac{12x_1 + 6 \\times 0.2x_1}{x_1} \\geq 10\\]\n   - This ensures that the average quality rating of bioethanol is at least 10.\n4. Biodiesel quality rating constraint: \\[\\frac{6x_2 + 12 \\times 0.8x_2}{x_2} \\geq 8\\]\n   - This ensures that the average quality rating of biodiesel is at least 8.\n5. Marketing demand generation constraint: \\[y_1 \\leq 8000\\]\n   - This ensures that the marketing dollars spent on bioethanol do not exceed the demand generated by 8,000 liters of bioethanol.\n6. Marketing demand generation constraint: \\[y_2 \\leq 12000\\]\n   - This ensures that the marketing dollars spent on biodiesel do not exceed the demand generated by 15,000 liters of biodiesel.\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal production and marketing strategies for bioethanol and biodiesel, maximizing the total profit for Green Energy Solutions while satisfying all production and marketing constraints.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nHere is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"GreenEnergyOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x1\")  # Amount of bioethanol produced\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x2\")  # Amount of biodiesel produced\ny1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"y1\")  # Amount of marketing dollars spent on bioethanol\ny2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"y2\")  # Amount of marketing dollars spent on biodiesel\n\n# Set the objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(30 * 8 * y1 + 25 * 15 * y2 - 12 * x1 - 6 * x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 + 0.8 * x2 <= 8000, name=\"FeedstockA\")\nmodel.addConstr(0.2 * x1 + x2 <= 12000, name=\"FeedstockB\")\nmodel.addConstr((12 * x1 + 6 * 0.2 * x1) / x1 >= 10, name=\"BioethanolQuality\")\nmodel.addConstr((6 * x2 + 12 * 0.8 * x2) / x2 >= 8, name=\"BiodieselQuality\")\nmodel.addConstr(y1 <= 8000, name=\"BioethanolMarketing\")\nmodel.addConstr(y2 <= 12000, name=\"BiodieselMarketing\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximum total profit: {:.2f} dollars\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Amount of bioethanol produced: {:.2f} liters\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Amount of biodiesel produced: {:.2f} liters\".format(x2.x))\n    print(\"Amount of marketing dollars spent on bioethanol: {:.2f} dollars\".format(y1.x))\n    print(\"Amount of marketing dollars spent on biodiesel: {:.2f} dollars\".format(y2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first create a `COPT` environment and model. Then, we add decision variables and set the objective function and constraints. Finally, we solve the model and output the results of the optimal solution, including the maximum total profit and the specific amounts of bioethanol and biodiesel produced, as well as the marketing dollars spent on each product.\n\nThis script provides a complete example of using the `coptpy` library to solve the profit maximization problem for Green Energy Solutions, while satisfying all the constraints mentioned in the problem.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create the model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"GreenEnergyOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x1\")  # Amount of bioethanol produced\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"x2\")  # Amount of biodiesel produced\ny1 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"y1\")  # Amount of marketing dollars spent on bioethanol\ny2 = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"y2\")  # Amount of marketing dollars spent on biodiesel\n\n# Set the objective function: Maximize total profit\nmodel.setObjective(30 * 8 * y1 + 25 * 15 * y2 - 12 * x1 - 6 * x2, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 + 0.8 * x2 <= 8000, name=\"FeedstockA\")\nmodel.addConstr(0.2 * x1 + x2 <= 12000, name=\"FeedstockB\")\nmodel.addConstr((12 * x1 + 6 * 0.2 * x1) / x1 >= 10, name=\"BioethanolQuality\")\nmodel.addConstr((6 * x2 + 12 * 0.8 * x2) / x2 >= 8, name=\"BiodieselQuality\")\nmodel.addConstr(y1 <= 8000, name=\"BioethanolMarketing\")\nmodel.addConstr(y2 <= 12000, name=\"BiodieselMarketing\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximum total profit: {:.2f} dollars\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Amount of bioethanol produced: {:.2f} liters\".format(x1.x))\n    print(\"Amount of biodiesel produced: {:.2f} liters\".format(x2.x))\n    print(\"Amount of marketing dollars spent on bioethanol: {:.2f} dollars\".format(y1.x))\n    print(\"Amount of marketing dollars spent on biodiesel: {:.2f} dollars\".format(y2.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": false, "execution_success": false, "mathematical_accuracy": false, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM/eval_execute/tmpgty64afw.py\", line 22, in <module>\n    model.addConstr((12 * x1 + 6 * 0.2 * x1) / x1 >= 10, name=\"BioethanolQuality\")\n  File \"coptcore.pyx\", line 7540, in coptcore.Model.addConstr\nValueError: Unsupported constraint sense\n", "execution_best_solution": null, "execution_state": "Execution Failed: 1"}

How to minimize the total cost while satisfying the demand and sustainability constraints?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for FreshFoods, we will establish a mathematical model to minimize the total cost of production, transportation, and resource usage while satisfying the demand and sustainability constraints. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): The amount of produce shipped from farm \\(i\\) to store \\(j\\), where \\(i\\) represents the farms (A, B, C) and \\(j\\) represents the stores (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} (ProductionCost_i + TransportationCost_{ij}) \\times x_{ij} + \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} WaterUsage_i \\times x_{ij} + \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} FertilizerUsage_i \\times x_{ij}\\]\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the production cost, transportation cost, water usage, and fertilizer usage for each farm, as well as the amount of produce shipped.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Meet the demand for each store: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} x_{ij} = Demand_j, \\forall j\\]\n2. Do not exceed the yield capacity of each farm: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij} \\leq YieldCapacity_i, \\forall i\\]\n3. Do not exceed the water usage limit: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} WaterUsage_i \\times x_{ij} \\leq 7 \\times \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij}\\]\n4.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\n### Problem Description:\nChemCo produces two types of solvents: Standard and Premium. The solvents are produced by blending five raw materials: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. Each raw material has four key properties:\n\n1.  Property 1: Viscosity Index (VI)\n2.  Property 2: Flash Point (°C)\n3.  Property 3: Boiling Point (°C)\n4.  Property 4: Density (g/cm³)\n\nThe properties, daily availability (in liters), and cost (in ¢/liter) of each raw material are given in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Raw Materials' Properties, Daily Availability, and Costs\n\n| Raw Material | Availability (Liters) | Cost (¢/Liter) | VI  | Flash Point (°C) | Boiling Point (°C) | Density (g/cm³) |\n|--------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Alpha        | 12,000                | 15.0           | 95  | 45               | 150                | 0.85            |\n| Beta         | 10,500                | 12.0           | 88  | 55               | 180                | 0.92            |\n| Gamma        | 8,000                 | 10.0           | 82  | 60               | 200                | 0.89            |\n| Delta        | 5,000                 | 18.0           | 105 | 40               | 130                | 0.87            |\n| Epsilon      | Unlimited             | 16.0           | 100 | 50               | 160                | 0.91            |\n\nThe final properties of the blended solvents are determined by the volume-weighted average of the properties of the raw materials used. The requirements for each solvent type are provided in Table 2. The Viscosity Index and Boiling Point requirements are minimums, while the Flash Point and Density requirements must be met exactly.\n\nTable 2: Solvent Requirements and Demand\n\n| Solvent  | Demand (Thousands of Liters) | VI (min) | Flash Point (°C) (exact) | Boiling Point (°C) (min) | Density (g/cm³) (exact) |\n|----------|-------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Standard | 8.5                           | 85       | 50                       | 140                      | 0.88                   |\n| Premium  | 25                            | 92       | 50                       | 140                      | 0.88                   |\n\nThe daily demand (in thousands of liters) for each solvent must be met, but additional production beyond the demand is allowed. Standard solvent sells for 25.50¢/liter, while Premium solvent sells for 28.75¢/liter. Additionally, no more than 35% of the volume of each solvent type can consist of raw material Beta. How can ChemCo formulate its solvents using the available raw materials to maximize its total daily profit? Total daily profit is defined as total revenue from sales minus total raw material costs.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): Volume

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nLogiCorp operates a logistics network that ships two types of products: Basic and Advanced. The raw materials needed to produce these products can be purchased for $5 per unit. Processing 1 unit of raw material requires 2 hours of warehouse labor. Each unit of processed raw material yields 2 units of Basic Product and 3 units of Advanced Product. Basic Product can be sold for $10/unit, and Advanced Product can be sold for $12/unit. LogiCorp also has the option of further processing Basic and Advanced Products to produce Premium Basic and Premium Advanced, which sell for $20/unit and $25/unit, respectively. Each unit of Basic Product processed further requires an additional 3 hours of warehouse labor and $5 processing cost, yielding 1 unit of Premium Basic. Each unit of Advanced Product processed further requires an additional 4 hours of warehouse labor and $6 processing cost, yielding 1 unit of Premium Advanced. Each year, LogiCorp has 8,000 hours of warehouse labor available and can purchase up to 3,000 units of raw material. How can LogiCorp maximize its profits? Assume that the cost of warehouse labor is a fixed cost, raw materials can only be purchased in whole units.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for LogiCorp, we will establish a linear programming model focused on maximizing profits while satisfying labor and raw material constraints. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x\\): Number of units of raw material purchased.\n- \\(y\\): Number of units of Basic Product produced.\n- \\(z\\): Number of units of Advanced Product produced.\n- \\(w\\): Number of units of Premium Basic Product produced.\n- \\(v\\): Number of units of Premium Advanced Product produced.\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of raw materials purchased and the quantities of products produced.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize profits: \\(P = 10y + 12z + 20w + 25v - 5x\\)\n  - This function calculates the total profit based on the quantities of each product sold and the quantities of raw materials purchased.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Raw material usage constraint: \\(2y + 3z \\leq x\\)\n   - This ensures that the total amount of raw materials used for producing Basic and Advanced Products does not exceed the quantity purchased.\n2. Warehouse labor constraint: \\(2x + 3w + 4v \\leq 8000\\)\n   - This constraint reflects the total labor hours required for processing raw materials and further processing products, which must not exceed the available 8,000 hours.\n3. Raw material purchase constraint: \\(x \\leq 3000\\)\n   - This ensures that the quantity of raw materials purchased does not exceed 3,000 units.\n4. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - \\(x, y, z, w, v \\geq 0\\) and must be integers, as raw materials can only be purchased in whole units, and products cannot be produced in fractions.\n\nUsing this model, linear programming techniques can be applied to find the optimal quantities of raw materials to purchase and the quantities of each product to produce in order to maximize profits while satisfying labor and raw material constraints. This will provide LogiCorp with the most economically efficient strategy for allocating its resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for LogiCorp:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for LogiCorp's optimization problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogiCorpOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of units of raw material purchased\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of units of Basic Product produced\nz = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"z\")  # Number of units of Advanced Product produced\nw = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"w\")  # Number of units of Premium Basic Product produced\nv = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"v\")  # Number of units of Premium Advanced Product produced\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2*y + 3*z <= x, name=\"RawMaterialUsageConstraint\")  # Raw material usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(2*x + 3*w + 4*v <= 8000, name=\"LaborConstraint\")  # Warehouse labor constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 3000, name=\"RawMaterialPurchaseConstraint\")  # Raw material purchase constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profits\nmodel.setObjective(10*y + 12*z + 20*w + 25*v - 5*x, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of raw material purchased: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Basic Product produced: {y.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Advanced Product produced: {z.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Premium Basic Product produced: {w.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Premium Advanced Product produced: {v.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first creates a COPT environment and model. Then, it defines five decision variables: `x` (number of units of raw material purchased), `y` (number of units of Basic Product produced), `z` (number of units of Advanced Product produced), `w` (number of units of Premium Basic Product produced), and `v` (number of units of Premium Advanced Product produced).\n\nNext, the script adds three constraints: raw material usage constraint, warehouse labor constraint, and raw material purchase constraint. These constraints ensure that the quantities of raw materials used, labor hours required, and raw materials purchased do not exceed the given limits.\n\nThe objective function is set to maximize profits, which is calculated based on the quantities of each product sold and the quantities of raw materials purchased.\n\nFinally, the model is solved, and if an optimal solution is found, the script prints out the maximized profit and the optimal values of each decision variable. If no optimal solution is found, it prints a message indicating this.\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for LogiCorp using the `coptpy` library, finding the optimal quantities of raw materials to purchase and the quantities of each product to produce in order to maximize profits while satisfying labor and raw material constraints.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a COPT model for LogiCorp's optimization problem\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogiCorpOptimization\")\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"x\")  # Number of units of raw material purchased\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"y\")  # Number of units of Basic Product produced\nz = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"z\")  # Number of units of Advanced Product produced\nw = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"w\")  # Number of units of Premium Basic Product produced\nv = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"v\")  # Number of units of Premium Advanced Product produced\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(2*y + 3*z <= x, name=\"RawMaterialUsageConstraint\")  # Raw material usage constraint\nmodel.addConstr(2*x + 3*w + 4*v <= 8000, name=\"LaborConstraint\")  # Warehouse labor constraint\nmodel.addConstr(x <= 3000, name=\"RawMaterialPurchaseConstraint\")  # Raw material purchase constraint\n\n# Set the objective function to maximize profits\nmodel.setObjective(10*y + 12*z + 20*w + 25*v - 5*x, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Analyze the solution\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(f\"Maximized profit: ${model.objval}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of raw material purchased: {x.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Basic Product produced: {y.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Advanced Product produced: {z.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Premium Basic Product produced: {w.x}\")\n    print(f\"Number of units of Premium Advanced Product produced: {v.x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": true, "execution_success": true, "mathematical_accuracy": false, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "2025-09-24 09:50:57 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.2.11 20250801\n2025-09-24 09:50:57 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM\n2025-09-24 09:50:57 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/miniconda3/envs/orlm/bin\n2025-09-24 09:50:57 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/qua/copt\n2025-09-24 09:50:57 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2025-09-24 09:50:57 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The company sources raw materials at a cost of $60 per unit. Each unit of raw material can be processed into 7 units of Engine Block and 3 units of Transmission. Processing one unit of raw material requires $8 in energy costs and 7 hours of machine time.  \n\nEngine Block can be used in three ways:  \n- Sold directly for $25 per unit.  \n- Processed into 1 unit of Transmission, requiring 4 hours of machine time and $5 in additional costs.  \n- Processed into 1 unit of Brake System, requiring 6 hours of machine time and $10 in additional costs.  \n\nTransmission can be used in two ways:  \n- Sold directly for $35 per unit.  \n- Processed into 1 unit of Brake System, requiring 5 hours of machine time and $12 in additional costs.  \n\nBrake System is sold for $45 per unit. The company has a maximum machine time capacity of 60,000 hours per year. Additionally, there is a contractual obligation to produce at least 4,000 units of Brake System annually. The maximum market demand for each component is as follows:  \n- Engine Block: 20,000 units  \n- Transmission: 15,000 units  \n- Brake System: 12,000 units  \n\nDetermine how AutoParts Ltd. can maximize its annual profit while meeting all constraints.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for AutoParts Ltd., we will establish a linear programming model to maximize the company's annual profit while considering the constraints of raw material supply, energy costs, machine time, market demand, and contractual obligations. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_1\\): Number of units of Engine Block sold directly.\n- \\(x_2\\): Number of units of Engine Block processed into Transmission.\n- \\(x_3\\): Number of units of Engine Block processed into Brake System.\n- \\(x_4\\): Number of units of Transmission sold directly.\n- \\(x_5\\): Number of units of Transmission processed into Brake System.\n- \\(x_6\\): Number of units of Brake System sold directly.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize annual profit: \\[Z = 25x_1 + 35x_4 + 45x_6 - 60(7x_1 + 3x_4 + 7x_3 + 3x_2 + 3x_5) - 8(7x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3 + 5x_5) - 7(7x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3 + 5x_5) - 5x_2 - 10x_3 - 12x_5\\]\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Raw material supply constraint: \\[7x_1 + 3x_4 + 7x_3 + 3x_2 + 3x_5 \\leq 7 \\times \\text{total units of raw material}\\]\n2. Energy cost constraint: \\[8(7x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3 + 5x_5) \\leq \\text{total energy cost}\\]\n3. Machine time constraint: \\[7x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3 + 5x_5 \\leq 60000\\]\n4. Contractual obligation to produce Brake System: \\[x_3 + x_5 + x_6 \\geq 4000\\]\n5. Market demand constraints:\n   - Engine Block: \\[x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \\leq 20000\\]\n   - Transmission: \\[x_4 + x_2 + x_5 \\leq 15000\\]\n   - Brake System: \\[x_3 + x_5 + x_6 \\leq 12000\\]\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6 \\geq 0\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal quantities of Engine Block, Transmission, and Brake System to be sold or processed, maximizing the company's annual profit while satisfying all constraints.

The company can produce a maximum of 1,500 doses per quarter, with each dose of Vaccine X requiring 4 liters of raw biochemical material and each dose of Vaccine Y requiring 3 liters. The cost of raw material is $300 per liter in Quarter 1 and $450 per liter in Quarter 2, with a maximum purchase limit of 2,500 liters per quarter, and material can only be used in the quarter it is purchased. At the start of Quarter 1, the company has an inventory of 200 doses of Vaccine X and 300 doses of Vaccine Y, and a storage cost of $100 per dose is assessed at the end of each quarter for remaining inventory. Additionally, the company must meet a regulatory requirement that the vaccines produced each quarter have an average efficacy rate of at least 90%, with Vaccine X having an efficacy rate of 85% and Vaccine Y having an efficacy rate of 95%. How to meet the demand and regulatory requirements at minimum cost, including raw material and storage costs.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for HealthSupply Co., we will establish a linear programming model focused on minimizing the total cost of raw material and storage while meeting the demand and regulatory requirements.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nTransitLogix Co. offers two competing shipping services: Priority and Economy. The company aims to sell these services to two distinct customer segments: small businesses and large enterprises. The perceived value of each service by the customer segments is shown in the table below: \n\n| Customer Segment | Value of Priority Service ($) | Value of Economy Service ($) |  \n|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|  \n| Small Businesses  | 120                            | 80                            |  \n| Large Enterprises | 90                             | 110                           |  \n\nEach customer will choose either Priority or Economy, but not both. If customers believe that the value of priority service exceeding its price is greater than or equal to the value of economic service exceeding its price, they will choose priority service. Similarly, If customers believe that the value of economic service exceeding its price is greater than or equal to the value of priority service exceeding its price, they will choose economic service. The small business segment has 1,000 potential customers, and the large enterprise segment has 1,500 potential customers. TransitLogix wants to set prices for each service to ensure that small businesses choose Priority and large enterprises choose Economy. And to maintain a clear differentiation and brand image, TransitLogix has decided that the price of the Priority service must be at least $15 higher than the price of the Economy service. How can TransitLogix maximize its total revenue from these two customer segments?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the pricing problem for TransitLogix Co., we need to construct a mathematical model to maximize the total revenue from the two customer segments while satisfying the price difference constraint. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(p\\): Price of the Priority service.\n- \\(e\\): Price of the Economy service.\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize total revenue: \\(Z = 1000 \\cdot (p - 120) \\cdot I(p - 120 \\geq e - 80) + 1500 \\cdot (e - 90) \\cdot I(e - 90 \\geq p - 110)\\)\n  - This function calculates the total revenue based on the prices of the services and the customer choices. \\(I\\) is an indicator function that takes a value of 1 when the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Price difference constraint: \\(p - e \\geq 15\\)\n   - This ensures that the price of the Priority service is at least $15 higher than the price of the Economy service.\n\n### Non-negativity constraints:\n- \\(p, e \\geq 0\\)\n  - This ensures that the prices are non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply nonlinear programming techniques to find the optimal prices for the Priority and Economy services that maximize total revenue while satisfying the price difference constraint. This will provide TransitLogix Co. with an optimal pricing strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the pricing problem for TransitLogix Co.:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TransitLogixPricing\")\n\n# Add decision variables\np = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"p\")  # Price of the Priority service\ne = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"e\")  # Price of the Economy service\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total revenue\nrevenue = 1000 * (p - 120) * model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY) + 1500 * (e - 90) * model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY)\nmodel.setObjective(revenue, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(p - e >= 15, name=\"PriceDifferenceConstraint\")  # Price difference constraint\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized total revenue: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal price for the Priority service: ${:.2f}\".format(p.x))\n    print(\"Optimal price for the Economy service: ${:.2f}\".format(e.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we add two decision variables `p` and `e`, representing the prices of the Priority and Economy services, respectively.\n\n3. In the objective function, we calculate the total revenue based on the prices of the services and the customer choices. To represent the customer choices, we introduce binary variables and use an indicator function to determine the customer choices. The objective is to maximize the total revenue.\n\n4. We add a constraint to ensure that the price of the Priority service is at least $15 higher than the price of the Economy service.\n\n5. Finally, we solve the model and output the maximized total revenue and the optimal prices for the services.\n\nNote that since the objective function contains a nonlinear term (the indicator function), this is a nonlinear programming problem. The `coptpy` library can handle nonlinear programming problems.\n\nBy running this script, we can find the optimal prices for the Priority and Economy services that maximize the total revenue from the two customer segments while satisfying the price difference constraint.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TransitLogixPricing\")\n\n# Add decision variables\np = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"p\")  # Price of the Priority service\ne = model.addVar(lb=0, name=\"e\")  # Price of the Economy service\n\n# Objective function: Maximize total revenue\nrevenue = 1000 * (p - 120) * model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY) + 1500 * (e - 90) * model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY)\nmodel.setObjective(revenue, sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\nmodel.addConstr(p - e >= 15, name=\"PriceDifferenceConstraint\")  # Price difference constraint\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Maximized total revenue: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal price for the Priority service: ${:.2f}\".format(p.x))\n    print(\"Optimal price for the Economy service: ${:.2f}\".format(e.x))\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": false, "execution_success": false, "mathematical_accuracy": false, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM/eval_execute/tmpuovntmzc.py\", line 22, in <module>\n    model.solve()\n  File \"coptcore.pyx\", line 11683, in coptcore.Model.solve\n  File \"coptcore.pyx\", line 12254, in coptcore.checkerror\ncoptcore.CoptError: 8, (NONCONVEX) Fail to solve problem\n", "execution_best_solution": null, "execution_state": "Execution Failed: 1"}

The company produces two types of packaging: Premium and Standard. Premium packaging sells for $15 per ton and must have an average quality score of at least 9. Standard packaging sells for $8 per ton and must have an average quality score of at least 7. The maximum demand is 2,500 tons of Premium packaging and 800 tons of Standard packaging per month. \n\nRecycled paper can be processed using one of three methods. The yield and cost per ton for each method are shown in the table below. For example, processing one ton of recycled paper using Method 1 costs $4.20 and yields 0.3 tons of quality score 6, 0.4 tons of quality score 8, and 0.3 tons of quality score 10. These costs include the expenses of acquiring the recycled paper. Before being converted into packaging materials, quality scores 6 and 8 can be enhanced through a refinement process. For $1.20 per ton, one ton of quality score 6 can be upgraded to quality score 8. For $1.80 per ton, one ton of quality score 8 can be upgraded to quality score 10.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): The amount of funds allocated to the \\(j\\)th investment option at the beginning of month \\(i\\), where \\(i\\) represents the month (1, 2, 3, 4) and \\(j\\) represents the investment option (1: invest for one month, 2: invest for two months, 3: invest for three months, 4: invest for four months).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Maximize the cash on hand at the beginning of month 5: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\left( \\text{Revenue}_i - \\text{Operational Expenses}_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij} \\right) + \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\left( \\text{Interest Rate}_j \\cdot x_{ij} \\right)\\]\n  - This function calculates the cash on hand at the beginning of month 5 based on the revenues, operational expenses, and investment returns for each month.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Fund allocation constraint: \\[\\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij} \\leq \\text{Available Funds}_i + \\text{Revenue}_i - \\text{Operational Expenses}_i, \\forall i\\]\n   - This ensures that the total amount of funds allocated to all investment options at the beginning of each month does not exceed the available funds plus the revenue minus the operational expenses for that month.\n2. Investment return constraint: \\[x_{i,j} = x_{i+1,j-1}, \\forall i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, \\forall j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}\\]\n   - This ensures that the funds allocated to the \\(j\\)th investment option at the beginning of month \\(i\\) are equal to the funds allocated to the \\(j-1\\)th investment option at the beginning of month \\(i+1\\).\n\n### Non-negativity constraint:\n- \\(x_{ij} \\geq 0, \\forall i, \\forall j\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal allocation of funds to each investment option at the beginning of each month, maximizing the cash on hand at the beginning of month 5 while meeting the operational obligations for each month.

Workers are scheduled in two consecutive 6-hour shifts and are paid $12 per hour. The possible shifts are as follows: midnight–6 A.M., 6 A.M.–noon, noon–6 P.M., and 6 P.M.–midnight. During each shift, the following numbers of orders arrive: midnight–6 A.M., 150; 6 A.M.–noon, 250; noon–6 P.M., 400; 6 P.M.–midnight, 300. Each worker can process up to 60 orders per shift. To account for customer dissatisfaction due to delayed orders, any order that remains unprocessed at the end of a shift incurs a penalty of $1. The warehouse ensures that all orders received by midnight are processed by the start of the next day, so the midnight–6 A.M. shift begins with no pending orders. How can Warehouse 24 minimize the total cost of labor and customer dissatisfaction penalties while meeting its order processing requirements?\n\n| Shift              | Orders Received |  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n| Midnight–6 A.M.    | 150             |  \n| 6 A.M.–Noon        | 250             |  \n| Noon–6 P.M.        | 400             |  \n| 6 P.M.–Midnight    | 300             |\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for Warehouse 24, we will establish a linear programming model focused on minimizing the total cost of labor and customer dissatisfaction penalties while meeting the order processing requirements. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_i\\): Number of workers in the \\(i\\)th shift, where \\(i\\) represents the shift (midnight–6 A.M., 6 A.M.–noon, noon–6 P.M., 6 P.M.–midnight).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total cost: \\[Z = 12 \\times \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\max(0, \\text{Orders Received}_i - 60 \\times x_i)\\]\n  - The first part represents the total cost of labor, where each worker is paid $12 per hour.\n  - The second part represents the total cost of customer dissatisfaction penalties, where any unprocessed orders incur a penalty of $1.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Order processing requirements for each shift:\n   - \\(60x_1 \\geq 150\\)\n   - \\(60x_2 \\geq 250\\)\n   - \\(60x_3 \\geq 400\\)\n   - \\(60x_4 \\geq 300\\)\n2. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - \\(x_i \\geq 0\\), for all \\(i\\).\n\n### Integer Constraint:\n- \\(x_i\\) must be integers, as the number of workers cannot be fractional.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of workers for each shift, minimizing the total cost while meeting the order processing requirements. This will provide Warehouse 24 with an economically efficient strategy for allocating its human resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for Warehouse 24:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"Warehouse24Optimization\")\n\n# Define the number of orders received for each shift\norders = [150, 250, 400, 300]\n\n# Define the number of orders that can be processed per worker per shift\norders_per_worker = 60\n\n# Define the wage per worker per hour\nwage_per_hour = 12\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = [model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=f\"x_{i}\") for i in range(4)]\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total cost\nlabor_cost = wage_per_hour * cp.quicksum(x[i] for i in range(4))\npenalty_cost = cp.quicksum(cp.max(0, orders[i] - orders_per_worker * x[i]) for i in range(4))\ntotal_cost = labor_cost + penalty_cost\nmodel.setObjective(total_cost, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Order processing requirements for each shift\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[0] >= orders[0], name=\"Shift1_Constraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[1] >= orders[1], name=\"Shift2_Constraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[2] >= orders[2], name=\"Shift3_Constraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[3] >= orders[3], name=\"Shift4_Constraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total cost: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    for i in range(4):\n        print(f\"Number of workers in Shift {i+1}: {x[i].x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define the input data for the problem, including the number of orders received for each shift, the number of orders that can be processed per worker per shift, and the wage per worker per hour. Then, it creates a `coptpy` model and adds decision variables representing the number of workers for each shift.\n\nNext, the script defines the objective function, which consists of two parts: the total cost of labor and the total cost of customer dissatisfaction penalties. The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of workers for each shift by the wage per hour. The penalty cost is calculated by comparing the number of orders received for each shift with the number of orders that can be processed by the workers, and any unprocessed orders incur a penalty.\n\nThen, the script adds constraints to ensure that the number of orders processed for each shift meets the order processing requirements.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the minimum total cost and the optimal number of workers for each shift (if an optimal solution is found).\n\nThis script provides a method to solve the optimization problem for Warehouse 24 using the `coptpy` library, finding the optimal number of workers for each shift to minimize the total cost while meeting the order processing requirements.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"Warehouse24Optimization\")\n\n# Define the number of orders received for each shift\norders = [150, 250, 400, 300]\n\n# Define the number of orders that can be processed per worker per shift\norders_per_worker = 60\n\n# Define the wage per worker per hour\nwage_per_hour = 12\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = [model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=f\"x_{i}\") for i in range(4)]\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total cost\nlabor_cost = wage_per_hour * cp.quicksum(x[i] for i in range(4))\npenalty_cost = cp.quicksum(cp.max(0, orders[i] - orders_per_worker * x[i]) for i in range(4))\ntotal_cost = labor_cost + penalty_cost\nmodel.setObjective(total_cost, sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Order processing requirements for each shift\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[0] >= orders[0], name=\"Shift1_Constraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[1] >= orders[1], name=\"Shift2_Constraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[2] >= orders[2], name=\"Shift3_Constraint\")\nmodel.addConstr(orders_per_worker * x[3] >= orders[3], name=\"Shift4_Constraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total cost: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    for i in range(4):\n        print(f\"Number of workers in Shift {i+1}: {x[i].x}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": false, "execution_success": false, "mathematical_accuracy": false, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM/eval_execute/tmpjqwrygct.py\", line 24, in <module>\n    penalty_cost = cp.quicksum(cp.max(0, orders[i] - orders_per_worker * x[i]) for i in range(4))\n  File \"coptcore.pyx\", line 12232, in coptcore.quicksum\n  File \"/orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM/eval_execute/tmpjqwrygct.py\", line 24, in <genexpr>\n    penalty_cost = cp.quicksum(cp.max(0, orders[i] - orders_per_worker * x[i]) for i in range(4))\nAttributeError: module 'coptpy' has no attribute 'max'\n", "execution_best_solution": null, "execution_state": "Execution Failed: 1"}

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nThe operations manager of QuickShip Logistics is trying to determine the number of warehouse supervisors needed to manage the company's distribution operations throughout the year. The estimated number of operational hours required each month is as follows:  \n\n| Month     | Operational Hours Needed |  \n|-----------|--------------------------|  \n| January   | 600                      |  \n| February  | 450                      |  \n| March     | 350                      |  \n| April     | 800                      |  \n| May       | 1,000                    |  \n| June      | 450                      |  \n| July      | 350                      |  \n| August    | 600                      |  \n| September | 450                      |  \n| October   | 350                      |  \n| November  | 250                      |  \n| December  | 150                      |  \n\nQuickShip Logistics aims to determine the optimal number of full-time warehouse supervisors to employ for the entire year, with the primary goal of minimizing total annual labor costs. These costs are composed of fixed monthly salaries of $5,000 for each supervisor (who are employed for all 12 months) and any overtime expenses incurred to meet fluctuating monthly operational hour demands. The company must ensure all operational tasks for each month are completed within that month, and all annual tasks are finalized by the end of December. \n\nEach of the N supervisors, when not taking their mandatory one-month annual paid vacation, can provide up to 160 standard operational hours monthly. To cover demands exceeding this standard capacity, these non-vacationing supervisors can work up to an additional 40 hours of overtime each per month, with overtime labor paid at a rate of $45 per hour. How can QuickShip Logistics minimize employment costs?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for the operations manager of QuickShip Logistics, we will establish a linear programming model to minimize total annual labor costs while ensuring that all operational tasks for each month are completed. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(N\\): The number of full-time warehouse supervisors employed for the entire year.\n- \\(O_t\\): The number of overtime hours for the \\(t\\)th month, where \\(t\\) represents the month (1, 2, ..., 12).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total annual labor costs: \\[Z = 5,000N + 45\\sum_{t=1}^{12} O_t\\]\n  - This function calculates the total cost of fixed salaries for all supervisors and overtime expenses.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Ensure that the operational hour demands for each month are met:\n   - For each month \\(t\\), \\(160N + O_t \\geq\\) the operational hour demand for month \\(t\\).\n2. Ensure that all annual tasks are completed:\n   - \\(\\sum_{t=1}^{12} (160N + O_t) \\geq\\) the sum of operational hour demands for all months.\n3. Overtime hours cannot exceed the number of non-vacationing supervisors:\n   - \\(O_t \\leq 40N\\), for all months \\(t\\).\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(N\\) must be a non-negative integer, as the number of supervisors cannot be negative or fractional.\n- \\(O_t \\geq 0\\), for all months \\(t\\), as the number of overtime hours cannot be negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal number of full-time warehouse supervisors to employ for the entire year, minimizing total annual labor costs while ensuring that all operational tasks for each month are completed. This will provide QuickShip Logistics with an economically efficient strategy for allocating human resources.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for the operations manager of QuickShip Logistics:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"WarehouseSupervisorOptimization\")\n\n# Monthly operational hour demands\nmonthly_demand = [600, 450, 350, 800, 1000, 450, 350, 600, 450, 350, 250, 150]\n\n# Add decision variables\nN = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.INTEGER, name=\"N\")  # Number of full-time warehouse supervisors\nO = [model.addVar(lb=0, name=f\"O_{t}\") for t in range(12)]  # Number of overtime hours for each month\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total annual labor costs\nmodel.setObjective(5000 * N + 45 * cp.quicksum(O), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Ensure that the operational hour demands for each month are met\nfor t in range(12):\n    model.addConstr(160 * N + O[t] >= monthly_demand[t], name=f\"DemandConstraint_{t+1}\")\n\n# Ensure that all annual tasks are completed\nmodel.addConstr(cp.quicksum(160 * N + O[t] for t in range(12)) >= sum(monthly_demand), name=\"AnnualDemandConstraint\")\n\n# Overtime hours cannot exceed the number of non-vacationing supervisors\nfor t in range(12):\n    model.addConstr(O[t] <= 40 * N, name=f\"OvertimeConstraint_{t+1}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total annual labor costs: ${:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Number of full-time warehouse supervisors: {}\".format(round(N.x)))\n    for t in range(12):\n        print(f\"Number of overtime hours for month {t+1}: {O[t].x:.2f}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis script first defines the monthly operational hour demands and then creates decision variables `N` and `O`, representing the number of full-time warehouse supervisors and the number of overtime hours for each month, respectively.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize total annual labor costs, including fixed salaries for all supervisors and overtime expenses.\n\nThe constraints include:\n1. Ensuring that the operational hour demands for each month are met.\n2. Ensuring that all annual tasks are completed.\n3.

And any two areas among the four areas are at least 100 units apart.\n\nHow should LogiTech locate the sorting and storage facilities to minimize daily transportation costs?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the optimization problem for LogiTech, we will establish a mathematical model to minimize the daily cost of moving goods through the distribution center while considering the constraints of facility location and goods movement. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_i, y_i\\): The coordinates of the \\(i\\)th facility, where \\(i\\) represents the facility (sorting facility, storage facility).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the daily cost of moving goods: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{sorting, storage\\}} \\sum_{j \\in \\{packaging, loading\\}} (distance_{ij} \\times trips_{ij} \\times cost_per_meter)\\]\n  - This function calculates the total cost based on the distance between each facility and each area, the number of daily trips, and the cost per meter.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Facility location constraints: \\(0 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 1000, \\forall i\\)\n   - This ensures that the facilities are located within the boundaries of the distribution center.\n2. Facility distance constraints: \\(\\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} \\geq 100, \\forall i \\neq j\\)\n   - This ensures that any two areas among the four areas are at least 100 units apart.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal locations for the sorting and storage facilities to minimize the daily cost of moving goods while satisfying the constraints of facility location and goods movement. This will provide LogiTech with an optimized resource allocation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization problem for LogiTech:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\nimport math\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogiTechOptimization\")\n\n# Define the coordinates of the areas\nareas = {\n    \"packaging\": (0, 0),\n    \"loading\": (800, 600),\n    \"sorting\": (0, 0),\n    \"storage\": (0, 0)\n}\n\n# Define the number of daily trips between the areas\ntrips = {\n    (\"packaging\", \"loading\"): 20,\n    (\"packaging\", \"sorting\"): 15,\n    (\"packaging\", \"storage\"): 10,\n    (\"loading\", \"sorting\"): 25,\n    (\"loading\", \"storage\"): 30,\n    (\"sorting\", \"storage\"): 40\n}\n\n# Define the cost per meter\ncost_per_meter = 0.5\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, ub=1000, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=f\"x_{i}\") for i in [\"sorting\", \"storage\"]}\ny = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, ub=1000, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=f\"y_{i}\") for i in [\"sorting\", \"storage\"]}\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(\n    math.sqrt((x[i] - areas[j][0])**2 + (y[i] - areas[j][1])**2) * trips[(j, i)] * cost_per_meter\n    for i in [\"sorting\", \"storage\"] for j in [\"packaging\", \"loading\"]\n), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\nfor i in [\"sorting\", \"storage\"]:\n    for j in [\"sorting\", \"storage\"]:\n        if i != j:\n            model.addConstr(cp.sqrt((x[i] - x[j])**2 + (y[i] - y[j])**2) >= 100, name=f\"Distance_{i}_{j}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum daily cost of moving goods: {:.2f} dollars\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal facility locations:\")\n    for i in [\"sorting\", \"storage\"]:\n        print(f\"{i}: ({x[i].x:.2f}, {y[i].x:.2f})\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define the coordinates of the areas, the number of daily trips between the areas, and the cost per meter. Then, we add decision variables to represent the coordinates of the sorting and storage facilities.\n\nNext, the script sets the objective function, which is to minimize the daily cost of moving goods. The objective function calculates the total cost based on the distance between each facility and each area, the number of daily trips, and the cost per meter.\n\nThen, the script adds constraints to ensure that any two facilities are at least 100 units apart.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the minimum daily cost of moving goods and the optimal facility locations.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the sorting and storage facilities are located at the same coordinates as the packaging and loading areas.

Each warehouse has an allocation of 2 smaller vehicles with a capacity of 20 units each for second-level delivery.\n\nThe goal is to assign customers to warehouses and plan optimal delivery routes for all vehicles to minimize the total distance traveled, subject to the following constraints:\n- Each customer must be served by exactly one van.\n- Each van must start and end its tour at its assigned warehouse.\n- The total demand on any vehicle's route cannot exceed its capacity.\n- The total demand flowing through an opened warehouse cannot exceed the capacity of the truck serving it.\n\n**Distances (km):**\n- **Depot to Warehouses:** Depot-W1: 30, Depot-W2: 40, Depot-W3: 35.\n- **Between Warehouses:** W1-W2: 25, W1-W3: 20, W2-W3: 30.\n- **Between Customers:** A full distance matrix is provided for travel between any two customers as follows:\n\n| | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 | C10 | C11 | C12 | C13 | C14 | C15 |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| C1 | 0 | 15 | 24 | 11 | 20 | 9 | 20 | 11 | 5 | 18 | 15 | 24 | 12 | 10 | 10 |\n| C2 | 15 | 0 | 18 | 21 | 13 | 12 | 5 | 12 | 15 | 24 | 18 | 11 | 22 | 19 | 13 |\n| C3 | 24 | 18 | 0 | 6 | 13 | 11 | 24 | 11 | 13 | 10 | 11 | 18 | 19 | 13 | 11 |\n| C4 | 11 | 21 | 6 | 0 | 11 | 16 | 12 | 18 | 11 | 19 | 10 | 11 | 14 | 19 | 10 |\n| C5 | 20 | 13 | 13 | 11 | 0 | 14 | 24 | 10 | 16 | 21 | 16 | 11 | 14 | 17 | 15 |\n| C6 | 9 | 12 | 11 | 16 | 14 | 0 | 19 | 18 | 23 | 19 | 18 | 10 | 15 | 11 | 12 |\n| C7 | 20 | 5 | 24 | 12 | 24 | 19 | 0 | 16 | 11 | 17 | 12 | 17 | 13 | 17 | 12 |\n| C8 | 11 | 12 | 11 | 18 | 10 | 18 | 16 | 0 | 18 | 13 | 12 | 17 | 18 | 13 | 16 |\n| C9 | 5 | 15 | 13 | 11 | 16 | 23 | 11 | 18 | 0 | 13 | 24 | 21 | 18 | 18 | 11 |\n| C10 | 18 | 24 | 10 | 19 | 21 | 19 | 17 | 13 | 13 | 0 | 12 | 22 | 12 | 19 | 17 |\n| C11 | 15 | 18 | 11 | 10 | 16 | 18 | 12 | 12 | 24 | 12 | 0 | 16 | 18 | 15 | 13 |\n| C12 | 24 | 11 | 18 | 11 | 11 | 10 | 17 | 17 | 21 | 22 | 16 | 0 | 19 | 19 | 13 |\n| C13 | 12 | 22 | 19 | 14 | 14 | 15 | 13 | 18 | 18 | 12 | 18 | 19 | 0 | 13 | 18 |\n| C14 | 10 | 19 | 13 | 19 | 17 | 11 | 17 | 13 | 18 | 19 | 15 | 19 | 13 | 0 | 18 |\n| C15 | 10 | 13 | 11 | 10 | 15 | 12 | 12 | 16 | 11 | 17 | 13 | 13 | 18 | 18 | 0 |\n\n- **Warehouses to Customers:** The specific distances are defined as follows:\n\n| From | To | Dist | | From | To | Dist | | From | To | Dist |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |-|:--- | :--- | :--- |-|:--- | :--- | :--- |\n| W1   | C1   | 12   | | W2   | C1   | 28   | | W3   | C1   | 18   |\n| W1   | C2   | 8    | | W2   | C2   | 22   | | W3   | C2   | 25   |\n| W1   | C3   | 15   | | W2   | C3   | 10   | | W3   | C3   | 9    |\n| W1   | C4   | 11   | | W2   | C4   | 14   | | W3   | C4   | 19   |\n| W1   | C5   | 7    | | W2   | C5   | 18   | | W3   | C5   | 24   |\n| W1   | C6   | 14   | | W2   | C6   | 9    | | W3   | C6   | 16   |\n| W1   | C7   | 10   | | W2   | C7   | 13   | | W3   | C7   | 12   |\n| W1   | C8   | 9    | | W2   | C8   | 17   | | W3   | C8   | 21   |\n| W1   | C9   | 13   | | W2   | C9   | 11   | | W3   | C9   | 7    |\n| W1   | C10  | 6    | | W2   | C10  | 20   | | W3   | C10  | 23   |\n| W1   | C11  | 14   | | W2   | C11  | 7    | | W3   | C11  | 10   |\n| W1   | C12  | 9    | | W2   | C12  | 16   | | W3   | C12  | 17   |\n| W1   | C13  | 11   | | W2   | C13  | 19   | | W3   | C13  | 22   |\n| W1   | C14  | 7    | | W2   | C14  | 12   | | W3   | C14  | 14   |\n| W1   | C15  | 13   | | W2   | C15  | 15   | | W3   | C15  | 8    |\n\n**Demands (units):**\n- C1:4, C2:7, C3:5, C4:6, C5:3, C6:8, C7:5, C8:6, C9:4, C10:7, C11:5, C12:6, C13:3, C14:8, C15:5.", "formulation": "Sets:\n1.

The objective is to plan vehicle routes for each day of the week to satisfy all delivery requirements while minimizing total distance traveled.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this logistics problem, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize total distance traveled while satisfying all delivery requirements. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ijk}\\): If vehicle \\(k\\) travels from customer \\(i\\) to customer \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ijk} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ijk} = 0\\). Here, \\(i, j\\) represent customers (including the depot, represented as 0), and \\(k\\) represents vehicles (1, 2, 3).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize total distance traveled: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=0}^{15}\\sum_{j=0}^{15}\\sum_{k=1}^{3} (distance_{ij} \\times x_{ijk})\\]\n  - This function calculates the total distance traveled based on the distances between each pair of customers and the decision variables.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each customer's delivery requirements must be satisfied: \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{15}\\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{ijk} = demand_j, \\forall j\\]\n2. The capacity of each vehicle must not exceed 200 units: \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{15}\\sum_{j=0}^{15} (demand_j \\times x_{ijk}) \\leq 200, \\forall k\\]\n3. Each vehicle must start and end at the depot: \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{15}\\sum_{j=0}^{15} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall k\\]\n4. Each customer can only be visited once per day: \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{15}\\sum_{k=1}^{3} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n5. For customers with daily delivery requirements, each vehicle must visit them every day: \\[\\sum_{j=0}^{15} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{daily\\}, \\forall k\\]\n6. For customers with every-other-day delivery requirements, each vehicle must visit them every other day: \\[\\sum_{j=0}^{15} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{every other day\\}, \\forall k, \\forall day\\]\n7. For customers with weekly delivery requirements, each vehicle must visit them once per week: \\[\\sum_{j=0}^{15} x_{ijk} = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{weekly\\}, \\forall k, \\forall day\\]\n\n### Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ijk} \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\), for all \\(i, j, k\\), to ensure that the solution is discrete and follows the logic of \"either fully selected or not selected\".\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer programming (specifically 0-1 integer programming) techniques to find out how to plan vehicle routes for each day of the week to minimize total distance traveled while satisfying all delivery requirements. This will provide the company with an optimal delivery strategy to improve logistics efficiency and reduce operational costs.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this logistics problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"LogisticsOptimization\")\n\n# Define parameters\nnum_customers = 15\nnum_days = 5\nnum_vehicles = 3\nvehicle_capacity = 200\n\n# Distance matrix\ndistances = [\n    [0, 12, 18, 9, 15, 22, 7, 14, 20, 11, 16, 8, 13, 19, 10, 17],\n    [12, 0, 6, 15, 21, 8, 17, 23, 10, 19, 4, 16, 5, 11, 18, 7],\n    [18, 6, 0, 21, 3, 14, 9, 15, 12, 5, 10, 7, 13, 8, 4, 11],\n    [9, 15, 21, 0, 18, 11, 16, 22, 7, 14, 20, 3, 19, 10, 17, 6],\n    [15, 21, 3, 18, 0, 17, 12, 8, 15, 10, 7, 13, 4, 9, 14, 11],\n    [22, 8, 14, 11, 17, 0, 19, 5, 12, 7, 14, 10, 17, 6, 13, 8],\n    [7, 17, 9, 16, 12, 19, 0, 14, 21, 8, 15, 11, 18, 5, 12, 9],\n    [14, 23, 15, 22, 8, 5, 14, 0, 17, 12, 9, 15, 6, 11, 16, 13],\n    [20, 10, 12, 7, 15, 12, 21, 17, 0, 13, 18, 4, 19, 14, 9, 16],\n    [11, 19, 5, 14, 10, 7, 8, 12, 13, 0, 15, 11, 6, 17, 12, 9],\n    [16, 4, 10, 20, 7, 14, 15, 9, 18, 15, 0, 17, 8, 13, 18, 5],\n    [8, 16, 7, 3, 13, 10, 11, 15, 4, 11, 17, 0, 14, 9, 16, 7],\n    [13, 5, 13, 19, 4, 17, 18, 6, 19, 6, 8, 14, 0, 15, 10, 17],\n    [19, 11, 8, 10, 9, 6, 5, 11, 14, 17, 13, 9, 15, 0, 7, 12],\n    [10, 18, 4, 17, 14, 13, 12, 16, 9, 12, 18, 16, 10, 7, 0, 11],\n    [17, 7, 11, 6, 11, 8, 9, 13, 16, 9, 5, 7, 17, 12, 11, 0]\n]\n\n# Customer demands\ndemands = [25, 30, 20, 15, 35, 40, 18, 22, 28, 32, 19, 21, 26, 24, 23]\n\n# Define decision variables\nx = [[[model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}_{k}\") for k in range(num_vehicles)] for j in range(num_customers+1)] for i in range(num_customers+1)]\n\n# Objective function: Minimize total distance traveled\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(distances[i][j] * x[i][j][k] for i in range(num_customers+1) for j in range(num_customers+1) for k in range(num_vehicles)), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# 1.

Then, it creates the decision variables `x[i][j][k]`, representing whether vehicle `k` travels from customer `i` to customer `j`.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize total distance traveled, calculated by summing the distances between each pair of customers and the corresponding decision variables.\n\nThe constraints include:\n1. Each customer's delivery requirements must be satisfied.\n2. The capacity of each vehicle must not exceed 200 units.\n3. Each vehicle must start and end at the depot.\n4. Each customer can only be visited once per day.\n5. For customers with daily delivery requirements, each vehicle must visit them every day.\n6. For customers with every-other-day delivery requirements, each vehicle must visit them every other day.\n7. For customers with weekly delivery requirements, each vehicle must visit them once per week.\n\nFinally, the script solves the model and outputs the minimum total distance traveled and the routes for each vehicle (if an optimal solution is found).\n\nNote that this script assumes specific customer delivery requirements (e.g., customers 1, 2, 4 have daily delivery requirements, customers 3, 5 have every-other-day delivery requirements, and customer 6 has weekly delivery requirements).

{"task_id": "D065", "description": "A regional tobacco distribution company operates three distribution centers located in different zones of a metropolitan area to serve 15 retail outlets. The company needs to optimize its weekly delivery operations to minimize total transportation costs while satisfying regulatory constraints and customer demands.\n\nThe three distribution centers have different storage capacities and operational costs. Center A can handle up to 800 units per week with a fixed operating cost of $2,500, Center B can handle up to 600 units per week with a fixed cost of $2,000, and Center C can handle up to 500 units per week with a fixed cost of $1,800. Each retail outlet has specific weekly demand requirements ranging from 45 to 120 units, and due to regulatory compliance, each outlet must receive deliveries from exactly one distribution center to maintain proper tracking and accountability.\n\nThe transportation cost varies based on the distance between distribution centers and retail outlets, ranging from $8 to $25 per unit delivered. Additionally, there are regulatory constraints that limit the maximum number of outlets each distribution center can serve - Center A can serve at most 7 outlets, Center B can serve at most 6 outlets, and Center C can serve at most 5 outlets. The company must also ensure that the total demand assigned to each center does not exceed its capacity, and all retail outlets must be served to maintain market coverage.\n\n| Outlet | Demand | Cost from A | Cost from B | Cost from C |\n|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1      | 85     | $12         | $18         | $22         |\n| 2      | 67     | $15         | $11         | $25         |\n| 3      | 92     | $20         | $14         | $16         |\n| 4      | 78     | $13         | $19         | $23         |\n| 5      | 105    | $17         | $12         | $20         |\n| 6      | 56     | $25         | $16         | $14         |\n| 7      | 120    | $14         | $21         | $18         |\n| 8      | 73     | $16         | $13         | $24         |\n| 9      | 89     | $19         | $15         | $17         |\n| 10     | 95     | $11         | $22         | $19         |\n| 11     | 62     | $23         | $17         | $15         |\n| 12     | 84     | $18         | $14         | $21         |\n| 13     | 76     | $21         | $20         | $13         |\n| 14     | 45     | $24         | $25         | $16         |\n| 15     | 58     | $22         | $23         | $12         |", "formulation": "Set:\n1.

The company needs to optimize its weekly delivery operations to minimize total transportation costs while satisfying regulatory constraints and customer demands.\n\nThe three distribution centers have different storage capacities and operational costs. Center A can handle up to 800 units per week with a fixed operating cost of $2,500, Center B can handle up to 600 units per week with a fixed cost of $2,000, and Center C can handle up to 500 units per week with a fixed cost of $1,800. Each retail outlet has specific weekly demand requirements ranging from 45 to 120 units, and due to regulatory compliance, each outlet must receive deliveries from exactly one distribution center to maintain proper tracking and accountability.\n\nThe transportation cost varies based on the distance between distribution centers and retail outlets, ranging from $8 to $25 per unit delivered. Additionally, there are regulatory constraints that limit the maximum number of outlets each distribution center can serve - Center A can serve at most 7 outlets, Center B can serve at most 6 outlets, and Center C can serve at most 5 outlets. The company must also ensure that the total demand assigned to each center does not exceed its capacity, and all retail outlets must be served to maintain market coverage.\n\n| Outlet | Demand | Cost from A | Cost from B | Cost from C |\n|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1      | 85     | $12         | $18         | $22         |\n| 2      | 67     | $15         | $11         | $25         |\n| 3      | 92     | $20         | $14         | $16         |\n| 4      | 78     | $13         | $19         | $23         |\n| 5      | 105    | $17         | $12         | $20         |\n| 6      | 56     | $25         | $16         | $14         |\n| 7      | 120    | $14         | $21         | $18         |\n| 8      | 73     | $16         | $13         | $24         |\n| 9      | 89     | $19         | $15         | $17         |\n| 10     | 95     | $11         | $22         | $19         |\n| 11     | 62     | $23         | $17         | $15         |\n| 12     | 84     | $18         | $14         | $21         |\n| 13     | 76     | $21         | $20         | $13         |\n| 14     | 45     | $24         | $25         | $16         |\n| 15     | 58     | $22         | $23         | $12         |\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\( x_{ij} \\): Represents the number of units delivered from distribution center \\( i \\) to retail outlet \\( j \\), where \\( i \\in \\{A, B, C\\} \\) and \\( j \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 15\\} \\).\n- \\( y_i \\): Binary variable indicating whether distribution center \\( i \\) is open (\\( y_i = 1 \\)) or closed (\\( y_i = 0 \\)).\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Demand Satisfaction Constraint**: The demand of each retail outlet must be fully satisfied.\n   $$\n   \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} x_{ij} = \\text{Demand}_j, \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 15\\}\n   $$\n2. **Distribution Center Capacity Constraint**: The total demand assigned to each distribution center must not exceed its capacity.\n   $$\n   \\sum_{j=1}^{15} x_{ij} \\leq \\text{Capacity}_i \\cdot y_i, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}\n   $$\n3. **Regulatory Constraint**: Each retail outlet must receive deliveries from exactly one distribution center.\n   $$\n   \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} y_i = 15\n   $$\n4. **Service Limit Constraint**: The number of outlets served by each distribution center must not exceed the regulatory limit.\n   $$\n   \\sum_{j=1}^{15} y_{ij} \\leq \\text{Service Limit}_i, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}\n   $$\n\n### Objective:\nMinimize total transportation costs:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize} \\quad Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} \\sum_{j=1}^{15} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij} + \\sum_{i \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} f_i \\cdot y_i\n$$\nwhere \\( c_{ij} \\) is the unit transportation cost from distribution center \\( i \\) to retail outlet \\( j \\), and \\( f_i \\) is the fixed operating cost of distribution center \\( i \\).\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nOf course, here is the COPT code generated based on the above mathematical model and problem background\n```python\nfrom coptpy import *\n\n# Create environment and model\nenv = Envr()\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TobaccoDistribution\")\n\n# Data\ncenters = ['A', 'B', 'C']\noutlets = list(range(1, 16))\ncapacities = {'A': 800, 'B': 600, 'C': 500}\nfixed_costs = {'A': 2500, 'B': 2000, 'C': 1800}\ndemands = {j: 85 + 22*j for j in outlets}  # Assumed demand data\nunit_costs = {(i, j): 8 + 2*j for i in centers for j in outlets}  # Assumed unit cost data\nservice_limits = {'A': 7, 'B': 6, 'C': 5}\n\n# Decision variables\nx = model.addVars(centers, outlets, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, nameprefix = \"x\")\ny = model.addVars(centers, vtype=COPT.BINARY, nameprefix = \"y\")\n\n# Objective function\nmodel.setObjective(sum(unit_costs[i, j] * x[i, j] for i in centers for j in outlets) +\n                   sum(fixed_costs[i] * y[i] for i in centers), COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Constraints\n# Demand satisfaction\nfor j in outlets:\n    model.addConstr(sum(x[i, j] for i in centers) == demands[j])\n\n# Distribution center capacity\nfor i in centers:\n    model.addConstr(sum(x[i, j] for j in outlets) <= capacities[i] * y[i])\n\n# Regulatory constraint\nmodel.addConstr(sum(y[i] for i in centers) == len(outlets))\n\n# Service limit\nfor i in centers:\n    model.addConstr(sum(y[i, j] for j in outlets) <= service_limits[i])\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.Status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Optimal solution found with total cost:\", model.objval)\n    for i in centers:\n        for j in outlets:\n            if x[i, j].x > 1e-6:  # Filter negligible values\n                print(f\"Center {i} delivers {x[i, j].x} units to outlet {j}\")\n```\nThis script sets up the model, defines the decision variables, constraints, and objective function, and solves the problem using the COPT solver.

The company aims to minimize its total annual operational cost, which consists of fixed daily costs for opening hubs and variable transportation costs for delivering goods.\n\nThe core decisions are which of the 5 potential hubs to open and which open hub should be assigned to serve each of the 15 retail stores.\n\nEach potential hub has a specific daily operating cost, a maximum daily capacity, and an operational reliability score. The company has a strategic requirement that the average reliability of all opened hubs must be at least 90%. The transportation cost is fixed at $0.80 per unit per mile, and the planning horizon is a full year (365 days).\n\nThe plan must assign each store to exactly one hub, ensure that no hub's daily capacity is exceeded, meet the minimum average reliability standard, and minimize the total annual cost.\n\nHub Data:  \n\n| Hub ID | Daily Setup Cost | Daily Capacity (units) | Reliability

The company sources ore from four different mines (M1, M2, M3, M4) with available quantities of 6000, 9000, 7000, and 5000 tons per month. \n\nEach ore type has different characteristics:\n- Metal recovery rates: M1=85%, M2=92%, M3=78%, M4=88%\n- Processing costs per ton: M1=$12, M2=$18, M3=$10, M4=$15\n- Sulfur content (impurity): M1=1.2%, M2=0.8%, M3=2.1%, M4=1.5%\n- Maximum allowed average sulfur content across all plants: 1.5%\n\nTransportation costs per ton from mines to plants:\n|       | P1  | P2  | P3  |\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|\n|   M1  | $4  | $6  | $5  |\n|   M2  | $7  | $5  | $8  |\n|   M3  | $3  | $4  | $6  |\n|   M4  | $8  | $6  | $7  |\n\nThe company needs to determine the optimal ore allocation from mines to plants to maximize total metal recovery while keeping total

{"task_id": "D079", "description": "PharmaLogistics Inc. is planning the distribution network for its new temperature-sensitive drug, 'VitaBoost', for the upcoming 6 months (Month 1 to Month 6). The company has two manufacturing plants (P1 located in City A, P2 located in City B) and is considering opening and operating up to three potential distribution centers (DC1 in Region X, DC2 in Region Y, DC3 in Region Z) to serve four key demand regions (R1, R2, R3, R4). The primary objective is to minimize the total operational costs over the 6-month planning horizon. These costs include: the fixed monthly costs of operating any active DCs, transportation costs for shipping VitaBoost from plants to DCs and from DCs to demand regions, inventory holding costs for products stored at DCs, costs associated with product expiry and disposal, and shortage costs incurred for any unmet demand in the regions.\n\nVitaBoost has a strict shelf life of 2 months. This means that any product manufactured in a given month (say, Month `m`) must be used to satisfy demand by the end of the following month (Month `m+1`). Product not used by this deadline expires and must be disposed of.\n\nAt the beginning of Month 1, DC1 has an initial stock of VitaBoost, provided it is chosen to be operational in Month 1: 10 units that were produced in the immediately preceding month (referred to as 'Month 0' batch, thus being 1-month old at the start of Month 1) and 5 units that were produced two months prior (referred to as 'Month -1' batch, thus being 2-months old at the start of Month 1). This 'Month -1' batch must be used or discarded during Month 1. No other initial inventory exists at other potential DCs or plants.\n\nThe monthly production capacities for the manufacturing plants are as follows (in units, for Months 1 through 6 respectively):\n-   Plant P1: [250, 250, 260, 260, 270, 270]\n-   Plant P2: [200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220]\n\nThe potential distribution centers have associated costs and capacities:\n-   Fixed monthly operating costs if active: DC1: $10,000; DC2: $12,000; DC3: $9,000.\n-   Storage capacities (max units): DC1: 300; DC2: 350; DC3: 280.\n\nTransportation costs per unit of VitaBoost are:\n-   From Plant P1 to DCs: DC1: $5, DC2: $7, DC3: $6.\n-   From Plant P2 to DCs: DC1: $8, DC2: $4, DC3: $7.\n-   From DC1 to Regions: R1: $3, R2: $4, R3: $5, R4: $6.\n-   From DC2 to Regions: R1: $5, R2: $3, R3: $4, R4: $5.\n-   From DC3 to Regions: R1: $4, R2: $5, R3: $3, R4: $4.\n\nOther relevant costs are:\n-   Monthly inventory holding cost per unit at DCs: DC1: $2.0; DC2: $2.5; DC3: $1.8.\n-   Disposal cost for expired product: $1 per unit at any DC.\n-   Shortage cost for unmet demand: $50 per unit, uniform across all regions and months.\n\nThe forecasted monthly demand for VitaBoost (in units) for each region over the 6-month horizon is:\n-   Region R1: [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]\n-   Region R2: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105]\n-   Region R3: [120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145]\n-   Region R4: [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]\n\nPharmaLogistics Inc. needs to determine an optimal plan that specifies: which DCs to operate in each month, the quantity of VitaBoost to produce at each plant monthly, and the detailed shipping and inventory quantities across the network.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nPharmaLogistics Inc. is planning the distribution network for its new temperature-sensitive drug, 'VitaBoost', for the upcoming 6 months (Month 1 to Month 6). The company has two manufacturing plants (P1 located in City A, P2 located in City B) and is considering opening and operating up to three potential distribution centers (DC1 in Region X, DC2 in Region Y, DC3 in Region Z) to serve four key demand regions (R1, R2, R3, R4). The primary objective is to minimize the total operational costs over the 6-month planning horizon. These costs include: the fixed monthly costs of operating any active DCs, transportation costs for shipping VitaBoost from plants to DCs and from DCs to demand regions, inventory holding costs for products stored at DCs, costs associated with product expiry and disposal, and shortage costs incurred for any unmet demand in the regions.\n\nVitaBoost has a strict shelf life of 2 months. This means that any product manufactured in a given month (say, Month `m`) must be used to satisfy demand by the end of the following month (Month `m+1`). Product not used by this deadline expires and must be disposed of.\n\nAt the beginning of Month 1, DC1 has an initial stock of VitaBoost, provided it is chosen to be operational in Month 1: 10 units that were produced in the immediately preceding month (referred to as 'Month 0' batch, thus being 1-month old at the start of Month 1) and 5 units that were produced two months prior (referred to as 'Month -1' batch, thus being 2-months old at the start of Month 1). This 'Month -1' batch must be used or discarded during Month 1. No other initial inventory exists at other potential DCs or plants.\n\nThe monthly production capacities for the manufacturing plants are as follows (in units, for Months 1 through 6 respectively):\n-   Plant P1: [250, 250, 260, 260, 270, 270]\n-   Plant P2: [200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220]\n\nThe potential distribution centers have associated costs and capacities:\n-   Fixed monthly operating costs if active: DC1: $10,000; DC2: $12,000; DC3: $9,000.\n-   Storage capacities (max units): DC1: 300; DC2: 350; DC3: 280.\n\nTransportation costs per unit of VitaBoost are:\n-   From Plant P1 to DCs: DC1: $5, DC2: $7, DC3: $6.\n-   From Plant P2 to DCs: DC1: $8, DC2: $4, DC3: $7.\n-   From DC1 to Regions: R1: $3, R2: $4, R3: $5, R4: $6.\n-   From DC2 to Regions: R1: $5, R2: $3, R3: $4, R4: $5.\n-   From DC3 to Regions: R1: $4, R2: $5, R3: $3, R4: $4.\n\nOther relevant costs are:\n-   Monthly inventory holding cost per unit at DCs: DC1: $2.0; DC2: $2.5; DC3: $1.8.\n-   Disposal cost for expired product: $1 per unit at any DC.\n-   Shortage cost for unmet demand: $50 per unit, uniform across all regions and months.\n\nThe forecasted monthly demand for VitaBoost (in units) for each region over the 6-month horizon is:\n-   Region R1: [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150]\n-   Region R2: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105]\n-   Region R3: [120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145]\n-   Region R4: [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]\n\nPharmaLogistics Inc. needs to determine an optimal plan that specifies: which DCs to operate in each month, the quantity of VitaBoost to produce at each plant monthly, and the detailed shipping and inventory quantities across the network. This plan must ensure that demand is met as effectively as possible while respecting the product's shelf life and minimizing total costs.\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve the distribution network planning problem for PharmaLogistics Inc., we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total operational costs over the 6-month planning horizon while satisfying the demand for VitaBoost in each region and the shelf life constraint. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(y_{i}^{m}\\): Whether distribution center \\(i\\) is operational in month \\(m\\). If operational, \\(y_{i}^{m} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(y_{i}^{m} = 0\\). \\(i\\) represents the distribution center (DC1, DC2, DC3), and \\(m\\) represents the month (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n- \\(x_{ij}^{m}\\): The quantity of VitaBoost shipped from plant \\(i\\) to distribution center \\(j\\) in month \\(m\\). \\(i\\) represents the plant (P1, P2), \\(j\\) represents the distribution center (DC1, DC2, DC3), and \\(m\\) represents the month (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n- \\(z_{jk}^{m}\\): The quantity of VitaBoost shipped from distribution center \\(j\\) to region \\(k\\) in month \\(m\\). \\(j\\) represents the distribution center (DC1, DC2, DC3), \\(k\\) represents the region (R1, R2, R3, R4), and \\(m\\) represents the month (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n- \\(s_{j}^{m}\\): The inventory quantity of VitaBoost at distribution center \\(j\\) at the end of month \\(m\\).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total operational costs: \\[Z = \\sum_{m=1}^{6} \\left( 10000y_{DC1}^{m} + 12000y_{DC2}^{m} + 9000y_{DC3}^{m} + \\sum_{i \\in \\{P1, P2\\}} \\sum_{j \\in \\{DC1, DC2, DC3\\}} (transportation\\_cost_{ij} \\times x_{ij}^{m}) + \\sum_{j \\in \\{DC1, DC2, DC3\\}} (inventory\\_holding\\_cost_j \\times s_{j}^{m}) + \\sum_{j \\in \\{DC1, DC2, DC3\\}} (disposal\\_cost \\times expired\\_product_{j}^{m}) + \\sum_{k \\in \\{R1, R2, R3, R4\\}} (shortage\\_cost \\times unmet\\_demand_{k}^{m}) \\right)\\]\n  - This function calculates the total operational costs based on the operational status of each distribution center, transportation costs, inventory holding costs, disposal costs for expired product, and shortage costs for unmet demand.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Monthly production capacity constraints for plants:\n   - \\(\\sum_{j \\in \\{DC1, DC2, DC3\\}} x_{P1,j}^{m} \\leq production\\_capacity_{P1}^{m}, \\forall m\\)\n   - \\(\\sum_{j \\in \\{DC1, DC2, DC3\\}} x_{P2,j}^{m} \\leq production\\_capacity_{P2}^{m}, \\forall m\\)\n2. Storage capacity constraints for distribution centers:\n   - \\(\\sum_{k \\in \\{R1, R2, R3, R4\\}} z_{j,k}^{m} + s_{j}^{m} \\leq storage\\_capacity_j, \\forall j, m\\)\n3. Demand satisfaction constraints for regions:\n   - \\(\\sum_{j \\in \\{DC1, DC2, DC3\\}} z_{j,k}^{m} = demand_{k}^{m}, \\forall k, m\\)\n4. Shelf life constraints for VitaBoost:\n   - \\(s_{j}^{m} = s_{j}^{m-1} + \\sum_{i \\in \\{P1, P2\\}} x_{ij}^{m} - \\sum_{k \\in \\{R1, R2, R3, R4\\}} z_{jk}^{m}, \\forall j, m\\)\n   - \\(s_{j}^{0} = 0, \\forall j\\)\n5. Non-negativity constraints:\n   - \\(x_{ij}^{m}, z_{jk}^{m}, s_{j}^{m} \\geq 0, \\forall i, j, k, m\\)\n6. Binary constraints:\n   - \\(y_{i}^{m} \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\forall i, m\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply mixed-integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal operational plan for each distribution center, the quantity of VitaBoost to produce at each plant monthly, and the detailed shipping and inventory quantities across the network, while minimizing the total operational costs and satisfying all demand and shelf life constraints. This will provide PharmaLogistics Inc. with an economically efficient distribution network planning strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the distribution network planning problem for PharmaLogistics Inc.:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"PharmaLogisticsOptimization\")\n\n# Define parameters\nmonths = range(1, 7)\nplants = ['P1', 'P2']\ndcs = ['DC1', 'DC2', 'DC3']\nregions = ['R1', 'R2', 'R3', 'R4']\n\n# Monthly production capacities for plants\nproduction_capacity = {\n    'P1': [250, 250, 260, 260, 270, 270],\n    'P2': [200, 200, 210, 210, 220, 220]\n}\n\n# Fixed monthly operating costs for distribution centers\nfixed_cost = {'DC1': 10000, 'DC2': 12000, 'DC3': 9000}\n\n# Storage capacities for distribution centers\nstorage_capacity = {'DC1': 300, 'DC2': 350, 'DC3': 280}\n\n# Transportation costs\ntransport_cost = {\n    ('P1', 'DC1'): 5, ('P1', 'DC2'): 7, ('P1', 'DC3'): 6,\n    ('P2', 'DC1'): 8, ('P2', 'DC2'): 4, ('P2', 'DC3'): 7,\n    ('DC1', 'R1'): 3, ('DC1', 'R2'): 4, ('DC1', 'R3'): 5, ('DC1', 'R4'): 6,\n    ('DC2', 'R1'): 5, ('DC2', 'R2'): 3, ('DC2', 'R3'): 4, ('DC2', 'R4'): 5,\n    ('DC3', 'R1'): 4, ('DC3', 'R2'): 5, ('DC3', 'R3'): 3, ('DC3', 'R4'): 4\n}\n\n# Inventory holding costs\ninventory_cost = {'DC1': 2.0, 'DC2': 2.5, 'DC3': 1.8}\n\n# Disposal cost for expired product\ndisposal_cost = 1\n\n# Shortage cost for unmet demand\nshortage_cost = 50\n\n# Monthly demand for regions\ndemand = {\n    'R1': [100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150],\n    'R2': [80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105],\n    'R3': [120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145],\n    'R4': [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85]\n}\n\n# Add decision variables\ny = {(i, m): model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"y_{i}_{m}\") for i in dcs for m in months}\nx = {(i, j, m): model.addVar(lb=0, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}_{m}\") for i in plants for j in dcs for m in months}\nz = {(j, k, m): model.addVar(lb=0, name=f\"z_{j}_{k}_{m}\") for j in dcs for k in regions for m in months}\ns = {(j, m): model.addVar(lb=0, name=f\"s_{j}_{m}\") for j in dcs for m in months}\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(fixed_cost[j] * y[j, m] for j in dcs for m in months) +\n                   cp.quicksum(transport_cost[i, j] * x[i, j, m] for i in plants for j in dcs for m in months) +\n                   cp.quicksum(inventory_cost[j] * s[j, m] for j in dcs for m in months) +\n                   cp.quicksum(disposal_cost * s[j, m] for j in dcs for m in months) +\n                   cp.quicksum(shortage_cost * (demand[k][m-1] -

{"task_id": "D080", "description": "A large manufacturing enterprise needs to ship a consignment of 1,000 tons of goods from its factory in City F to a distribution center in City D. There are three potential transportation routes available. Each route is composed of segments using different modes of transport (road or rail).

Furthermore, certain road segments are subject to a congestion fee to account for the social costs of traffic. This fee is non-linear and is calculated as `Congestion Coefficient * (Total Traffic Flow)^2`.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nA large manufacturing enterprise needs to ship a consignment of 1,000 tons of goods from its factory in City F to a distribution center in City D. There are three potential transportation routes available. Each route is composed of segments using different modes of transport (road or rail). The transportation cost for each segment is calculated based on a per ton-kilometer rate. Furthermore, certain road segments are subject to a congestion fee to account for the social costs of traffic. This fee is non-linear and is calculated as `Congestion Coefficient * (Total Traffic Flow)^2`. The total traffic flow on a segment is the sum of the cargo shipped by the enterprise and the existing background traffic from other companies.\n\nThe details for the three routes are provided in the table below. For congested segments, the existing background traffic is also listed.\n\n| Route | Segment | Mode | Distance (km) | Base Fee ($/ton-km) | Congestion Coefficient | Background Traffic (tons) |\n| ----- | ------- | ---- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 1     | 1A      | Road | 150           | 2.00                | 5×10−7                 | 2,000                     |\n|       | 1B      | Rail | 500           | 0.80                | -                      | -                         |\n| 2     | 2A      | Road | 200           | 2.10                | -                      | -                         |\n|       | 2B      | Road | 350           | 1.90                | 8×10−7                 | 1,500                     |\n| 3     | 3A      | Road | 100           | 2.20                | -                      | -                         |\n|       | 3B      | Rail | 600           | 0.75                | -                      | -                         |\n\nHow should the enterprise allocate the shipment of 1,000 tons of goods across the three routes to minimize the total transportation cost?\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\nTo solve this transportation problem, we need to construct a mathematical model to minimize the total transportation cost while satisfying the shipment requirement. The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_i\\): The amount of goods shipped on route \\(i\\), where \\(i\\) represents the route (1, 2, 3).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total transportation cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j \\in \\{1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B\\}} \\left( \\text{Base Fee}_j \\times \\text{Distance}_j \\times x_i + \\text{Congestion Coefficient}_j \\times (\\text{Background Traffic}_j + x_i)^2 \\right) \\right)\\]\n  - This function calculates the total transportation cost based on the amount of goods shipped on each route, the base fee, distance, congestion coefficient, and background traffic for each segment.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Shipment requirement: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i = 1000\\]\n   - This ensures that the total amount of goods shipped on all routes meets the shipment requirement.\n2. Non-negativity constraint: \\[x_i \\geq 0, \\forall i\\]\n   - This ensures that the amount of goods shipped on each route is non-negative.\n\nUsing this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal amount of goods to ship on each route, minimizing the total transportation cost while satisfying the shipment requirement. This will provide the enterprise with an economically efficient transportation strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this transportation problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TransportationOptimization\")\n\n# Define decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x1\")\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x2\")\nx3 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x3\")\n\n# Define the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(\n    2.00 * 150 * x1 + 5e-7 * (2000 + x1)**2 +\n    0.80 * 500 * x1 +\n    2.10 * 200 * x2 +\n    1.90 * 350 * x2 +\n    8e-7 * (1500 + x2)**2 +\n    2.20 * 100 * x3 +\n    0.75 * 600 * x3,\n    sense=COPT.MINIMIZE\n)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 + x2 + x3 == 1000, name=\"DemandConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total transportation cost: {:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal shipment allocation:\")\n    print(f\"Route 1: {x1.x:.2f} tons\")\n    print(f\"Route 2: {x2.x:.2f} tons\")\n    print(f\"Route 3: {x3.x:.2f} tons\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We first create a COPT environment and model.\n\n2. Then, we define three decision variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, representing the amount of goods shipped on routes 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\n3. Next, we set the objective function based on the given data in the problem description. The objective function includes the base fee, distance, congestion coefficient, and background traffic for each segment.\n\n4. We add a constraint to ensure that the total amount of goods shipped on all routes equals 1,000 tons.\n\n5. We call `model.solve()` to solve the model.\n\n6. Finally, we check the solution status of the model. If an optimal solution is found, we output the minimum total transportation cost and the optimal shipment allocation. Otherwise, we output a message indicating that no optimal solution was found.\n\nNote that since the congestion fee is non-linear, this problem is actually a non-linear programming problem. `coptpy` can handle non-linear objective functions and constraints, so we can directly use it to solve this problem.", "extracted_code": "import coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"TransportationOptimization\")\n\n# Define decision variables\nx1 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x1\")\nx2 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x2\")\nx3 = model.addVar(lb=0, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, name=\"x3\")\n\n# Define the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(\n    2.00 * 150 * x1 + 5e-7 * (2000 + x1)**2 +\n    0.80 * 500 * x1 +\n    2.10 * 200 * x2 +\n    1.90 * 350 * x2 +\n    8e-7 * (1500 + x2)**2 +\n    2.20 * 100 * x3 +\n    0.75 * 600 * x3,\n    sense=COPT.MINIMIZE\n)\n\n# Add constraints\nmodel.addConstr(x1 + x2 + x3 == 1000, name=\"DemandConstraint\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total transportation cost: {:.2f}\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Optimal shipment allocation:\")\n    print(f\"Route 1: {x1.x:.2f} tons\")\n    print(f\"Route 2: {x2.x:.2f} tons\")\n    print(f\"Route 3: {x3.x:.2f} tons\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "syntactic_correctness": true, "semantic_correctness": true, "execution_success": true, "mathematical_accuracy": true, "optimization_formulation": true, "execution_result": "2025-09-24 09:51:06 [INFO] checks license for COPT v7.2.11 20250801\n2025-09-24 09:51:06 [WARN] no license files in current working folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/code/opt/ORLM\n2025-09-24 09:51:06 [WARN] no license files in binary folder: /orcd/home/002/qua/miniconda3/envs/orlm/bin\n2025-09-24 09:51:06 [WARN] no license files in HOME folder: /home/qua/copt\n2025-09-24 09:51:06 [INFO] empty environment variable: COPT_LICENSE_DIR\n2025-09-24 09:51:06 [WARN] no license files in EV 'COPT_LICENSE_DIR': \n\nNo license found.

The model can be formulated as follows:\n\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\(x_{ij}\\): If blood center \\(i\\) is selected to serve hospital \\(j\\), then \\(x_{ij} = 1\\); otherwise, \\(x_{ij} = 0\\). Here, \\(i\\) represents the candidate cities (C1, C2, C3, C4), and \\(j\\) represents the hospitals (H1, H2, H3).\n\n### Objective Function:\n- Minimize the total construction cost: \\[Z = \\sum_{i \\in \\{C1, C2, C3, C4\\}} \\sum_{j \\in \\{H1, H2, H3\\}} (construction\\_cost_i \\times x_{ij})\\]\n\n### Constraints:\n1. Each hospital can only be served by one blood center: \\[\\sum_{i \\in \\{C1, C2, C3, C4\\}} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall j\\]\n2. Each blood center can serve at most one hospital: \\[\\sum_{j \\in \\{H1, H2, H3\\}} x_{ij} \\leq 1, \\forall i\\]\n3. Reliability requirement: \\[\\prod_{i \\in \\{C1, C2, C3, C4\\}} (1 - 0.00005 \\times (distance_{ij})^2 \\times x_{ij}) \\geq 0.9, \\forall j\\]\n   - This constraint ensures that the joint supply failure probability for each hospital is less than 10%.\n\n### Binary Constraints:\n- \\(x_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1\\}, \\forall i, j\\)\n\nUsing this model, we can apply integer linear programming techniques to find the optimal solution for selecting the two locations for the blood centers, minimizing the total construction cost while satisfying the reliability requirement. This will provide the national health agency with an optimized blood center location strategy.\n\n## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:\nBelow is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport coptpy as cp\nfrom coptpy import COPT\nimport math\n\n# Create a COPT environment\nenv = cp.Envr()\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = env.createModel(\"BloodCenterLocationOptimization\")\n\n# Candidate city and hospital data\ncities = ['C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4']\nhospitals = ['H1', 'H2', 'H3']\n\n# Construction costs (in million yen)\nconstruction_costs = {'C1': 8, 'C2': 7, 'C3': 9, 'C4': 7.5}\n\n# Distances (in km)\ndistances = {\n    'C1': {'H1': 50, 'H2': 80, 'H3': 120},\n    'C2': {'H1': 60, 'H2': 40, 'H3': 90},\n    'C3': {'H1': 110, 'H2': 70, 'H3': 50},\n    'C4': {'H1': 130, 'H2': 100, 'H3': 60}\n}\n\n# Add decision variables\nx = {(i, j): model.addVar(vtype=COPT.BINARY, name=f\"x_{i}_{j}\") for i in cities for j in hospitals}\n\n# Set the objective function\nmodel.setObjective(cp.quicksum(construction_costs[i] * x[i, j] for i in cities for j in hospitals), sense=COPT.MINIMIZE)\n\n# Add constraints\n# Each hospital can only be served by one blood center\nfor j in hospitals:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for i in cities) == 1, name=f\"Hospital_{j}_served_by_one_center\")\n\n# Each blood center can serve at most one hospital\nfor i in cities:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quicksum(x[i, j] for j in hospitals) <= 1, name=f\"City_{i}_serves_at_most_one_hospital\")\n\n# Reliability requirement\nfor j in hospitals:\n    model.addConstr(cp.quickprod(1 - 0.00005 * (distances[i][j]**2) * x[i, j] for i in cities) >= 0.9, name=f\"Reliability_requirement_for_hospital_{j}\")\n\n# Solve the model\nmodel.solve()\n\n# Output the results\nif model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:\n    print(\"Minimum total construction cost: {:.2f} million yen\".format(model.objval))\n    print(\"Selected blood center locations:\")\n    for i in cities:\n        for j in hospitals:\n            if x[i, j].x > 0.5:  # If x_ij is greater than 0.5, consider the blood center at location i serving hospital j\n                print(f\"Blood center at location {i} serves hospital {j}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nIn this script, we first define the candidate cities, hospitals, construction costs, and distances. Then, it creates decision variables `x` representing whether a blood center at location `i` serves hospital `j`.\n\nThe objective function is to minimize the total construction cost, calculated by summing the construction costs of all selected blood centers.\n\nThe constraints include:\n1.

This operational cost is uniquely challenging, as it is proportional to the square of the number of batteries replaced by a van in a given zone (Cost = Coefficient × N²), reflecting a diseconomy of scale due to on-site logistical complexities.\nThe plan must ensure that all e-bikes with low-power batteries are serviced, while also respecting the maximum number of new batteries each van can carry. The core decision is how to assign the battery-swapping workload—which zones each van should service, and how many batteries to replace in each—to meet all demands at the lowest possible total cost. All necessary operational data is provided below.\n\nTable 1: Zonal Demand Data\n\n| Zone | Total E-Bikes | Low Battery Percentage (%) |\n|:----:|:--------------:|:--------------------------:|\n|   A  |      200       |             60             |\n|   B  |      150       |             80             |\n|   C  |      180       |             50             |\n\nTable 2: Maintenance Station Parameters\n\n| Parameter                    | Van 1 | Van 2 |\n|:-----------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|\n| Dispatch Cost ($)            |  300  |  320  |\n| Max Battery Capacity (units) |  150  |  180  |\n| Operational Cost Coefficient | 0.08  | 0.07  |", "formulation": "Set\n1.

The route starts at a central depot, serves 10 customers, and then returns to the depot. The courier's travel speed is constant at 30 km/h, and the travel cost is ¥5 per kilometer.\nEach customer has a desired \"service time window.\" If the courier's actual arrival time deviates from the center of the customer's desired time window, the company incurs a \"customer satisfaction penalty\" cost. This cost is proportional to the square of the time deviation, calculated by the formula: $Cost = 0.2 \\times (\\text{Actual Arrival Time} - \\text{Time Window Center})^2$.\nThe company's objective is to determine a unique customer visit sequence and calculate a precise arrival time for each customer to minimize the cost.

{"task_id": "D089", "description": "A shared mobility company plans to deploy a fleet of 1,000 electric scooters across five key hotspot zones in a city. To ensure service stability and a positive user experience, the company aims to achieve a balanced deployment that aligns with the demand profile of each zone.\n\nThe company's goal is to minimize the network's imbalance. This imbalance is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the number of scooters deployed in each zone and an ideal, attractiveness-weighted deployment. The ideal deployment for a zone is calculated by distributing the total fleet proportionally to that zone's share of the total attractiveness.\n\nWhen planning the deployment, the following conditions must be met:\n1. The total number of scooters deployed across all zones must equal 1,000.\n2. To align operational capacity with potential demand, the number of scooters in each zone must not be less than a minimum quota. This quota is set at 10% of the total fleet size, weighted by the proportion of that zone's attractiveness relative to the total attractiveness of all zones.\n3. The 'Commercial Center' and 'Transit Hub' zones are geographically adjacent and frequently interact with each other. To ensure service continuity, the absolute difference in the number of scooters deployed in these two zones must not exceed 50.\n4. The company has divided the zones into two operational clusters: Cluster 1 (Commercial Center, Tourist Area) and Cluster 2 (University City, Tech Park, Transit Hub). Each cluster can deploy a maximum of 600 scooters to match the management capacity of local operational teams.\n\nThe attractiveness data for each zone is provided in the table below.

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nA shared mobility company plans to deploy a fleet of 1,000 electric scooters across five key hotspot zones in a city. To ensure service stability and a positive user experience, the company aims to achieve a balanced deployment that aligns with the demand profile of each zone.\n\nThe company's goal is to minimize the network's imbalance. This imbalance is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the number of scooters deployed in each zone and an ideal, attractiveness-weighted deployment. The ideal deployment for a zone is calculated by distributing the total fleet proportionally to that zone's share of the total attractiveness.\n\nWhen planning the deployment, the following conditions must be met:\n1. The total number of scooters deployed across all zones must equal 1,000.\n2. To align operational capacity with potential demand, the number of scooters in each zone must not be less than a minimum quota. This quota is set at 10% of the total fleet size, weighted by the proportion of that zone's attractiveness relative to the total attractiveness of all zones.\n3. The 'Commercial Center' and 'Transit Hub' zones are geographically adjacent and frequently interact with each other. To ensure service continuity, the absolute difference in the number of scooters deployed in these two zones must not exceed 50.\n4. The company has divided the zones into two operational clusters: Cluster 1 (Commercial Center, Tourist Area) and Cluster 2 (University City, Tech Park, Transit Hub). Each cluster can deploy a maximum of 600 scooters to match the management capacity of local operational teams.\n\nThe attractiveness data for each zone is provided in the table below. Please devise a deployment plan that minimizes the network imbalance while satisfying all constraints.\n\nTable: Zonal Attractiveness Data\n\n| Hotspot Zone | Attractiveness (Predicted Daily Trips) |\n|:---|:---|\n| Commercial Center | 500 |\n| University City | 800 |\n| Tech Park | 700 |\n| Tourist Area | 600 |\n| Transit Hub | 900 |\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\( x_i \\): The number of scooters deployed in hotspot zone \\( i \\), where \\( i \\) represents the zones (Commercial Center, University City, Tech Park, Tourist Area, Transit Hub).\n\n### Constraints:\n1.

{"task_id": "D090", "description": "A community food bank plans to dispatch a refrigerated truck on a Friday afternoon to visit 4 partner supermarkets and collect same-day leftover fresh food donations. The truck has a maximum refrigerated capacity of 2 cubic meters and a payload limit of 500 kilograms. The truck will depart from the food bank at 13:00 and must return by 17:00, for a total operating time of 4 hours. The food bank's geographic coordinates are (0, 0), and the units for all location coordinates are kilometers (km).

The truck has a maximum refrigerated capacity of 2 cubic meters and a payload limit of 500 kilograms. The truck will depart from the food bank at 13:00 and must return by 17:00, for a total operating time of 4 hours. The food bank's geographic coordinates are (0, 0), and the units for all location coordinates are kilometers (km). The truck's travel speed is a constant 40 km/h, and the distance between two points is calculated using straight-line Euclidean distance. Additionally, each stop at a supermarket for loading operations requires a fixed 20 minutes. The objective of the task is to plan an optimal route, deciding which supermarkets to visit and which items to collect, in order to maximize the total sum of priority weights of the collected donations. The detailed locations of each supermarket and the information on available donations are shown in the table below:\n\n| Stop | Location Coordinates (km) | Donation Item | Volume (m³) | Weight (kg) | Priority Weight |\n|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Supermarket S1 | (5, 10) | Milk | 0.8 | 150 | 80 |\n| Supermarket S1 | (5, 10) | Cheese | 0.3 | 50 | 65 |\n| Supermarket S2 |(15, 5) | Bread | 1.0 | 100 | 50 |\n| Supermarket S2 |(15, 5) | Vegetables | 0.5 | 80 | 40 |\n| Supermarket S3 |(20, 15) | Frozen Meat | 0.6 | 200 | 100 |\n| Supermarket S3 |(20, 15) | Pasta | 0.4 | 60 | 45 |\n| Supermarket S4 |(25, 20) | Fruit | 0.7 | 120 | 60 |\n| Supermarket S4 |(25, 20) |Yogurt | 0.4 | 100 | 70 |\n| Supermarket S4 |(25, 20) | Berries | 0.2 | 30 | 55 |\n| Supermarket S5 |(30, 25) | Eggs | 0.3 | 40 | 75 |\n| Supermarket S5 |(30, 25) | Butter | 0.2 | 50 | 50 |\n| Supermarket S6 |(35, 30) | Sausages | 0.5 | 110 | 90 |\n| Supermarket S6 |(35, 30) | Fish Fillets | 0.4 | 90 | 95 |\n| Supermarket S7 |(40, 35) | Juice | 0.6 | 120 | 30 |\n| Supermarket S7 |(40, 35) | Canned Soup | 0.8 | 150 | 25 |\n| Supermarket S8 |(45, 40) | Salad Mix | 0.9 | 70 | 35 |\n\n# Response:", "generated_output": " ## Mathematical Model:\n### Decision Variables:\n- \\( x_{ij} \\): Binary variable indicating whether to visit supermarket \\( j \\) and collect donation item \\( i \\) (1 if yes, 0 if no).\n- \\( t_{j} \\): Continuous variable representing the time of arrival at supermarket \\( j \\).\n- \\( y_{j} \\): Binary variable indicating whether to visit supermarket \\( j \\) (1 if yes, 0 if no).\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Time Window Constraint**: The truck must depart from the food bank at 13:00 and return by 17:00.\n   $$\n   t_{0} = 0, \\quad t_{N+1} = 4, \\quad t_{j} - t_{j-1} \\geq 20y_{j} \\quad \\forall j = 1, \\ldots, N\n   $$\n2. **Capacity Constraint**: The total volume and weight of the collected donations must not exceed the truck's maximum capacity.\n   $$\n   \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} v_{i} x_{ij} \\leq 2, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{i} x_{ij} \\leq 500\n   $$\n3. **Visit Constraint**: Each supermarket can be visited at most once.\n   $$\n   \\sum_{j=1}^{N} y_{j} \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall i = 1, \\ldots, M\n   $$\n4. **Logical Constraint**: If a supermarket is not visited, no donation items can be collected.\n   $$\n   x_{ij} \\leq y_{j} \\quad \\forall i = 1, \\ldots, M;

Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nA container terminal needs to allocate berths for a fleet of 10 cargo ships within the next 72 hours. The terminal has 3 available berths (B1, B2, B3). Due to interdependencies where some ships carry import/export goods required by other ships, there are collaborative operation requirements between them. Specifically, ship C can only start loading after ship A completes unloading; ship E can only start loading after ship D completes unloading. To incentivize efficient collaboration, a **¥50,000 \"rapid transshipment\" bonus** can be earned if the start time of a dependent task (e.g., C starting to load) immediately follows the completion time of its predecessor task (e.g., A completing unloading) with a time gap of 2 hours or less. Ship information and operational requirements are shown in Table 1. The objective is to assign each ship a unique berth and a conflict-free berthing time window to maximize the total rapid transshipment bonus while minimizing the ships' waiting time costs in the port** (¥2,000 per hour).\n\nTable 1: Ship Information and Operational Requirements\n\n| Ship ID | Operation Type | Dependencies | Estimated Arrival Time (hours) | Required Berth Operation Time (hours) |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|\n| A | Unloading | -
